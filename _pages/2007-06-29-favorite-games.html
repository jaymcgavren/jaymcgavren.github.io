<tr valign="top">
<td>ActRaiser</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Probably the strangest mix of genres ever seen in a game, but it's still an excellent title. You clear an area of monsters in a highly playable platformer, then build a city there while fending off further monster attacks. The graphics and classical music are great. A must.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Adventure Island II</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Serves up more of the same action from the first but you can now ride any of several dinosaurs, all with different powers. Rivals SMB3.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Arkanoid</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>The best breakout game in existence, very addictive. Bounce a ball  around the screen to break bricks and catch powerups to give your paddle  various abilities like firing lasers. Nice graphics. Works okay with the control pad but it's best if you can find one of the analog dial controllers that was originally included (if it still works).</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Bahamut Lagoon</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>A brilliant RPG by Square. Movement on the battlefield is handled a-la  Shining Force, but any hand-to-hand combat takes place in a Final-Fantasy  style battle sequence. The art is reminiscient of FF3, and the special  effects are phenomenal. Not as deep as Tactics Ogre but every bit as  enjoyable. Worthy of import.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Batman</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>One of the few NES movie licenses to do credit to its namesake. Challenging and highly playable. The animation is awesome, and the graphics recreate the dark, gothic look of the movie perfectly.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Battletoads and Double Dragon</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>One of the most ridiculous character crossovers in history, but a great game nonetheless. Places less emphasis on the ridiculously hard sub-games than the original Battletoads. So impressive graphically that the publisher saw fit to port it to the SNES as-is (which admittedly was a mistake but hey, what do you want from a NES?)</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Berzerk</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Work through a labyrinth, blasting robots before they can do the same to you. As close as the 2600 gets to Smash TV.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Bionic Commando</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Why, WHY hasn't this game appeared on any system since the NES? Instead of jumping your character swings across gaps on a grappling hook. Stellar gameplay but the graphics are showing their age a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Bust-a-Move</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>A bizarre mix of billiards and Columns that actually works. Shoot sticky bubbles into groups of the same color to clear them. Two player versus mode is best but the one player version is good too.  <a title="c" name="c"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Bust-A-Move 2</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>Ah, now this is more like it. As far as I'm concerned this is Bub and Bob's main game, not Bubble Bobble. Crosses pool with a color-matching puzzle game. (Just try it.) Kawaii characters and beautiful backgrounds should get your  girlfriend to play, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Castlevania III</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Reverts back to the original's strictly-action policy (a good thing). Play as four different characters with diverse abilities. The most graphically impressive of the NES CV games.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Castlevania IV</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Probably the best Castlevania on any platform to date. Decent graphics, awesome gameplay, cool (and very unique) music, and some nice special effects.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Centipede</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Awesome, colorful graphics and the gameplay's none too shabby. Wish I'd gotten to play with a trackball but it's not too bad with the joystick.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Chrono Trigger</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Aside from the poor character animation this game is practically  perfect. The backgrounds are beautiful, the music is fantastic, and the special effects are eye-popping. Lots of different endings, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Columns</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Long regarded as Tetris' nemesis. Arrange falling jewels to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal group of 3 of the same color. Has a more serious atmosphere than most current puzzle games, and the graphics are beginning to show their age a bit. The gameplay is still great, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Contra</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>A game way ahead of its time. Run and gun your way through hordes of aliens, alone or in two player simultaneous play. Lots of different weapons available, and the action is very solid.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Cool Spot</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>You play as 7up's awesome mascot. The character animation is awesome and the gameplay is great. Unfortunately some of the scenery is recycled in the later levels, and the ending may not be worth the considerable frustration involved in clearing the last part of the game.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Crash Bandicoot</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>Okay, so it's Donkey Kong Country in 3D. I don't care. The gameplay is solid, the graphics are awesome, and the main character is way cool.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Crusader of Centy</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>The similarity to Zelda III in terms of graphics and gameplay cannot be coincidence. The quality is also a close copy, so this is worth a look if you liked Zelda. Now if only your animal helpers didn't look so cheesy as they  followed you around - they are always one step in back of you, which means  they hover over pits and pass through walls sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Darkwing Duck</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>The game feels a lot like Mega Man (same publisher) but adds a few neat moves like shielding yourself with your cape. Stellar gameplay and great graphics, well worth a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Demon Attack</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Excellent graphics, intense play, and lots of cool enemies. A must see.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Donkey Kong</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>The graphics are as good as can be expected and the gameplay is  intact. Not all the levels are here, unfortunately. The Coleco and NES versions are much better translations but this one's worth a play as  well simply because it's the version so many fondly remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Donkey Kong 3</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>This I can get into. Appealing graphics and audio, great gameplay and control. Very addictive.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Donkey Kong Country</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Pretty rendered graphics and decent gameplay to boot. Everyone and their dog's played it, of course, so why do you need my review?</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Donkey Kong Country 2</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>DK gets ditched in favor of a strange new chick with moves that don't work into the gameplay as well. I personally like the first better. The  music is awesome, though, and the graphics are almost 32-bit quality.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Donkey Kong Country 3</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>OK, the series is getting old, already. And what's the big idea  getting rid of Diddy Kong for this new brat? Sure, it's a good game, but definitely not worth it if you own either of the first two.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Donkey Kong Junior</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Like DK the Coleco and NES versions are much better but by itself the 2600 version is a great game. Very similar to DK in graphic style. <a title="e" name="e"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Duck Hunt</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>A simplistic but highly addictive game for use with the Zapper. Your choice of two games - shooting down ducks or clay pigeons. Too bad you can't shoot the *&amp;%$ smartass hunting dog like in the arcade.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Fighter's Megamix</td>
<td>Sega Saturn</td>
<td>Virtua Fighter characters with Street Fighter gameplay? Sure, I'm game. The graphics are  lame but it's got The Character Roster of the Gods. Try it at least, even if you don't own a  Saturn.  <a title="g" name="g"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Final Fantasy</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Cower before the master. Final Fantasy offers battle depth which only the most recent Dragon Warrior games can compete with, and graphics that other NES RPGs can't hold a candle to.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Final Fantasy II</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Although FF3 blows this aging game away graphically I don't think I'll  ever remember its characters or quest as fondly as I do FF2's. FF2 also doesn't have that depressing second world...</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Final Fantasy III</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Beautiful graphics that border on art, awesome special effects rivaled only by Chrono Trigger, lots of optional subquests, and some exceedingly cool characters. People are gonna forget all about this one when FF7 comes  out but it's still a cool game.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Fox Trot</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>With Bloom County, Calvin and Hobbes, and the Far Side all gone to that big funnies page in the sky this is the only reason I have left to read the comics. Endearing characters, fast-paced humor, and a great art style. If your local paper doesn't carry it start writing letters!  <a title="g" name="g"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Frogger</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Dodge cars on a highway, then hop logs on a raging river to try  and reach your lily pad. Decent graphics and stellar gameplay.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>F-Zero</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Back when the SNES first came out this was the graphical creme de la creme. It no longer claims that title but the colorful look is still great and the gameplay is outstanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Ghouls 'n' Ghosts</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Colorful graphics and awesome gameplay. Two gripes, though. Once you jump you're committed to a landing spot even if there's an enemy there. Also, after clearing the first 6 stages you have to go back and play through the game again. Still worthy of mention in the same breath as Sonic.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Gunstar Heroes</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Contra who? Gunstar adds the ability to throw enemies at each other when you get close to the standard run and shoot formula. Colorful, cartoony characters and enemies, and some really awesome graphic effects. And the bosses! <a title="h" name="h"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Horned Owl</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>A cool anime intro, awesome 3D scenery which you fly through a la Steel Gunner, and light gun support. The 2D sprites used for enemies repeat a lot but that's my only gripe.  <a title="i" name="i"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Ice Hockey</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Two on two hockey, one of the best two player games on the 2600. Nice graphics and great gameplay.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Joust</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>A fantastic two player game, since you can team up against  enemies or try to take each other out. (Or both. "Oops, sorry,  Glen, the controller slipped...") Awesome graphics, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Jr. Pac-Man</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>One of the best games 2600 has to offer. All the action of  Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man but the mazes are bigger and more varied,  the play is faster, and the audio and graphics are infinitely better.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>King of Fighters '95</td>
<td>Sega Saturn</td>
<td>This is everything the Playstation version should have been. Even in multi-character mode,  the load times are short enough not to be annoying. Most of the frames of animation are intact,  too. You'll need to get your Saturn modified to run it, though; it uses a RAM cart so the  Game Shark isn't an option. That's okay, this game is worth it.  <a title="l" name="l"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>King of Fighters '95</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>An excellent Street Fighter clone with a large cast of characters. Adds a much-needed single-character mode to the arcade's team mode. Needs better controller configuration and the load times are too long. The Saturn version's better.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Klax</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Might be the best puzzle game on the NES, though Pipe Dream puts up a fight for the title. Regardless Klax is an excellent game. Addictive and  insanely fast paced. The graphics are awesome, the sound effects are great, and the music is fantastic. Don't pass up a copy if you manage to find one.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Lemmings 2</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>A decent port of the sadistic strategy game. If you haven't played Lemmings you're missing out bigtime. The sequel offers tons of new tricks the Lemmings can do. Should keep anyone who can stand a little frustration busy for eons.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mario Bros.</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>The Super Mario series we all know and love begins to  take shape in this game. Knock enemies off their feet from below, then kick them off the playfield. Nice graphics and it allows two players at once.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Maxi 15</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>A collection of 15 games in one cart, a showcase for some of American Video Entertainment's best (ahem) titles. The high rating is for Krazy  Kreatures (see review on this page), which is the only decent game this  cart contains. Also included are Dudes with Attitude, Deathbots, Chiller, and Pyramid among others. Your only shot at finding one is at a video rental store that's selling off its stock of older games.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mega Man</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>A collector may charge you twenty bucks for this but it's worth many  times that. The Mega Man series is famous for its stellar gameplay, and  this is the best of that series. The graphics are spartan but beautifully designed, the enemies and bosses are perfectly engineered, and the game is challenging but never cheap. Awesome control, lots of weapons, total platformer perfection.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mega Man 2</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>No changes were made to the control or character graphics, but a comparison to MM1 shows the importance of careful enemy design. Sure, the enemies are still well done, but nowhere near as fun to fight as Sniper Joe, Cut Man, or Bomb Man. Still highly playable, but the series never regained the original's spark.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mega Man 3</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>The addition of Mega Man's slide maneuver is decidedly welcome, and brings some life back that was lost in MM2. The longest Mega Man game yet with 16 stages. The graphics are more complex but not as appealing as in the prior games.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mega Man 4</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Here the series goes into a bit of a slump. There are some cheap hits, and the game begins to drag a bit after you beat the coolest bosses. Mega Man's main gun can now be charged up.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mega Man 5</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>No major additions, and if you've played all the other games up to this point even a great series like this can get tiresome.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mega Man 6</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>The graphics are among the most colorful and eye pleasing ever seen on  the NES and the enemy design comes nearer its former glory. Fans of the  series who've purchased every game may balk at a sixth, but try it even if  you're a Mega Man fan.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mega Man 7</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Unfortunately Mega Man and Mega Man X are two totally separate entities in Capcom's eyes, so you can't cling to walls as you can in the X games. You'll soon forget about that, though, when you see the awesome character  animation and cool weapons. There's even a hidden two player versus mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mega Man X</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>This game has playability not seen in the Mega Man series since MM2. Beating the game won't take too long but finding all the hidden items may not be so easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mega Man X2</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>More of the same from the first. The backgrounds are beautiful and  there are even more hidden powerups to be found.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mega Man X3</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Finally, you get to play as Zero! Unfortunately you're only allowed to do so for part of each round, and waiting for him to warp in and out is so annoying you won't want to do it very often. Aside from that it's the same old excellent Mega Man game.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Megamania</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Blast wave after wave of descending ships. (Sound familiar?) Megamania is distinguished, however, by its incredible variety of enemies and colorful graphics. A must-play.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Midnight Magic</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>It's no match for the NES' Pinball, but this is the best  pinball game available for 2600. The graphics put Video Pinball (and some games from completely different genres) to shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>The graphics make good screenshots but one boxing ring looks just like another. What the game lacks in graphic variety it easily makes up in gameplay. You're rooted to one spot, but this puts you right in the path of your opponent's every attack, forcing you to react and find the right time to counterpunch. Definitely not a realistic boxing sim, but one hell of an action game.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Missile Command</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Until the release of Arcade Classics - The Atari Collection for Playstation, this was the only incarnation available on consoles, and if you haven't played it you absolutely must. Set off explosions to detonate incoming warheads before they reach  your cities. Chain reactions are possible, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Moon Patrol</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Your lunar rover is under attack, and you must avoid rocks, jump pits, and take out enemy fighters overhead - usually all at once. Nice graphics and excellent gameplay.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Ms. Pac-Man</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Improved graphically over the decidedly ugly Pac-Man, and offers more mazes. Pick this up if you can't find Jr. Pac-Man. <a title="n" name="n"></a> <a title="o" name="o"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Ms. Pac-Man</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>The sound could be better but this game is perfect in every other aspect. Not quite an exact translation from the arcade but the NES version has brand-new mazes, the optional ability to speed up with the A button, and awesome new two player simultaneous cooperative and competitive modes where you can play as Pac-Man. Highly addictive!</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Ogre Battle</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>A war sim mixed with RPG elements. You control several platoons of fantasy creatures and send them from town to town to liberate the countryside. If a platoon encounters enemy troops a traditional RPG battle begins. Beautiful, colorful graphics and nice special effects. I swear, if I hear one more dumbass refer to this as "Orgy Battle"...</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Phantasy Star II</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Cool graphics, likable characters, and an intriguing story. Not as complex as later games but an absolute must-see for any RPG lover.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Phantasy Star IV</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>PS4 puts the series back on track. The graphics are in much the same style as PS2, although the radiant color is gone. The story is told in awesome manga- style cinemas. The game is quite lengthy. Although it's well scripted the  plot dies halfway through. (Venegance is a powerful motive but what's left after you're avenged?) Still worthy of mention in the same breath as the Square epics.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Pipe Dream</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Like many SFami releases by BulletProof Software, this one could've  almost been released as-is in the U.S., but for some reason never was.  Enhancements over the NES version include a variety of backgrounds,  different pre-set obstacle layouts for each stage, and a fun two player  simultaneous mode. An improvement on a game that was already a blast.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Pitfall</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>You'd better at least have played this as the hidden game in Mayan Adventure. (It's better than the main game...)  Pitfall has excellent graphics, challenging gameplay, and  more variety of obstacles than almost any other 2600 game...</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Pitfall II</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>...almost. Pitfall II goes way beyond the original with a huge area to explore and actual music. This is as close as the 2600 gets to modern-day platformers.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Pocky and Rocky</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>This game oozes Japanese culture so if you have no tolerance for  bizarre humor you may want to avoid it. But you'll be missing out on some of the best graphics, sound, and gameplay ever seen on the SNES. You can knock incoming bullets back or dive out of the way. Allows two players simultaneously, too. Look out, Commando.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Pocky and Rocky 2</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Although the sequel offers even better graphics, more characters, and  more secrets to find, the two player mode is ruined because half the time player two is out of the game. Rent before you buy.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Pop'n Twinbee</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>The only Twinbee game ever released in the U.S. was Stinger for the  NES. It's too bad because Pop'n Twinbee is one of the best shooters of  all time. Not a huge powerup system but you can pick up options, drop  screen bombs, chuck grenades at enemies on the ground, and punch to  block incoming bullets. Awesome control and great gameplay. Import it!</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Q-Bert</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>An excellent Pac-Man-esque game with appealing graphics and surprisingly good control. <a title="r" name="r"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Qix</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>I fetched a handsome price when I auctioned my copy off months ago, but I still regret it, especially since I doubt I can find a replacement. I've played a variety of clones on PC and other consoles, but they can't match the control and graphic appeal of the NES version. Highly addictive. Find  a copy if you can, so you can sell it to me. <a title="r" name="r"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>R.C. Pro-Am</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Doesn't offer much graphic variety but the animation on the cars is unbelievable and the control is great - just like a radio-controlled car. Weapons spice the race up a bit, too. Oh, for a two player option...</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Ridge Racer</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>A highly playable arcade-style racer. Nice graphics with a zippy framerate. Unfortunately there's only one main track, although this is quite large and scenic, and extensions can be added onto it.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>River Raid</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Yes, it's an actual scrolling shooter, and one of a quality rarely seen even today. Race down a river while  avoiding the banks and shooting down enemy boats and  choppers. Fly over fuel tanks occasionally or you risk  running out of gas. Challenging and addictive. A must. <a title="s" name="s"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Rocket Knight Adventures</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>A cartoony Contra. You play Sparkster, an opossum in armor with a jetpack strapped to his back. Challenging and highly playable. Great graphics.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Romancing Sa-Ga 3</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Magnificent, colorful graphics and a play style much like the Final Fantasy series but with more depth to the battles. Tons of characters but not much of a storyline for any of them. (But if you can't read Japanese, who cares?) Definitely one to import!</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Rudora No Hihou</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>A traditional RPG by Square. Needless to say, it's worth importing.  The graphics are wonderful, the animation in battles is without compare,  and the special effects are great. The menu system is quite different  from the Final Fantasy series but isn't too difficult to decipher.  This is as good as a 16-bit RPG gets.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Secret of Mana</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Not as polished as Zelda and the character animation could be better but the graphics and music are beautiful and the three player option is a big bonus.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Shining Force</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Instead of the typical group battle approach of other RPGs, you maneuver individual soldiers into position on a battlefield and then watch the cinemas as they cast spells or spears at their enemy. The list of playable characters is huge. The storyline lacks but that's my only complaint. Very enjoyable.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Shining Force II</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Basically the same as the first but with an even larger character roster. Buy this first but be warned that you'll want the original as well later. A welcome break from the old Final Fantasy formula.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Sonic and Knuckles</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Sonic 3's character graphics were retained, Tails was ditched, and a new character, Knuckles, was brought in. The cartridge port on top allows you to plug in a Sonic 2 or 3 cartridge so you can play as Knuckles in either of those games, which is a nice feature if you want to sell Sonic games.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Offers graphics improved over even Sonic 1, more neato tunes, a new 2 player split-screen race mode, and my second-favorite game mascot, Tails the fox.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Unfortunately they reworked the character graphics for this one, and I don't like Sonic's new look. The stages aren't designed for speed like before, and you encounter a boss in every stage (no more playing for the fastest time).  The new levels and graphic effects are great, but there's only 6 worlds.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Soul Blazer</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Beautiful graphics and enjoyable gameplay. It's more simplistic than Zelda but from a playability standpoint that's a good thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Soul Edge</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>Toshinden has competition. Graphically impressive but falls short of Tekken 2 in gameplay and framerate. This home version features different (in appearance) weapons, 6 for each character. Awesome intro.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Stampede</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Almost a shooter, but your goal is to rope cows before they get past you and escape. Challenging and very  playable.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Street Fighter Alpha</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>Rock-solid gameplay and graphics but a small character roster and very few backgrounds. You want the sequel instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Streets of Rage 2</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Adds one more playable character for a choice of four, plus new moves for everyone. The soundtrack is every bit as awesome as in the first game.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Streets of Rage 3</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>Still more moves are available, the lumbering Max has been replaced with a cooler character, and two more hidden characters can be added to the four  standard ones. No brawler before or since has offered better gameplay or variety. Too bad Yuzo didn't do as well on the soundtrack this time; some of the tracks are awful. (There are still a few winners on there, though.)</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Super Bomberman</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>In keeping with the Bomberman tradition the one player version is  awful, but get four people together and the ensuing onscreen chaos will keep everyone up all night. This is the most simplistic of the SNES versions, and indeed that may be for the best.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Super Bomberman 2</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Pretty much the same game with a couple new powerups and new options. The new multiplayer arenas are a bit too complex for me. Still an awesome, awesome game.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Super Breakout</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>Aside from Arkanoid this is the best game in the genre. Includes several variations on the theme, including  multiball games. Pick descending mode if you really want  pressure. Simple but appealing graphics and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Super Mario Bros. 2</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>It wasn't originally a Mario game but it works just as well with Mario's face on it. Beautiful graphics, original gameplay, and your choice of four characters to play as. Not addictive but still enjoyable.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Super Mario Bros. 3</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>The best Super Mario game (and that does include Mario 64). Excellent control, appealing graphics, and it's extremely long. (Why isn't there a save option?) Lots of different powerups are available and there are many hidden areas to find. The stages with giant enemies are so cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Super Mario World</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Colorful graphics, decent gameplay, and dozens of unique stages to explore. You ought to play this but you probably already have.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Super Metroid</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Wandering around the labyrinthine halls aimlessly can get a little  tedious after a while, but the game is spiced up by marvelous graphics, fantastic music, and a great storyline. One question - what on earth inspired Nintendo to add that ridiculous voice sample to the intro?</td>

<td>Super Punch-Out!</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Goes well beyond the original in terms of graphics. The roster of  opponents is much larger, too. The gameplay hasn't been changed much but  then it doesn't need to be.</td>

<td>Super Street Fighter II</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>The best fighting game available for Genesis, though it pales in comparison to the 32-bit fighters. A huge 16-character roster, great graphics, and  great playability.</td>

<td>Surround</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>The most commonly known incarnation of this is Tron's lightcycles. Steer your wall around a closed arena, and try and avoid crashing into yourself and your opponent's wall. An awesome two player game that for some reason  hasn't appeared on any other console.</td>
</tr>

<td>Tekken</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>10 playable bosses (which are admittedly largely derivative of the 8 main characters) will keep players busy for quite some time trying to master everyone. The gameplay is shallow but extremely enjoyable and addictive.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Tekken 2</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>With a huge character roster, a rendered intro and ending for each and every character, cool new moves like the counters, and a lightning fast pace, you simply won't have time to see everything this game has to offer. A truly epic game.</td>

<td>Tetris &amp; Dr. Mario</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>No-frills versions of Tetris and Dr. Mario with colorful graphics  and great control. Not exactly action-packed like later puzzle games  but Tetris is still a pleasant diversion.</td>

<td>Tetris (Nintendo)</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>I don't have to tell you what a thoroughly addictive game Tetris can be, but some versions are poor implementations of a great concept. Nintendo's isn't one of them, with great control and the most appealing graphics of any version for any system...</td>
</tr>

<td>Tetris (Tengen)</td>
<td>Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>...But the version Nintendo denied us by suing Tengen to remove their version from circulation is that much better. I don't like the darker colors as well but Tengen's version offers more play options and a two player  simultaneous mode. I understand Nintendo's reasons for their actions, but fuck them for rubbing salt in the wound by bringing out an inferior product.</td>

<td>Treasure Hunter G</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>Developed by Sting (no, not that Sting) and published by Square. The battle system is vaguely similar to Shining Force's, but fights move along much, much faster. Beautiful backgrounds, awesome special effects, wonderful music. As good as or better than Chrono Trigger. Square should definitely translate this for the U.S. but there's no way they will with the SNES on its deathbed.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Urban Strike</td>
<td>Sega Genesis</td>
<td>A mix of action and strategy. Pilot several vehicles, mainly helicopters, on a variety of complex missions. Slow-paced but very detailed and highly enjoyable once you get into it. Graphically improved over Jungle Strike. <a title="v" name="v"></a></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Virtua Cop</td>
<td>Sega Saturn</td>
<td>The premiere light gun game available for home systems. Knockout graphics and adrenaline-infused  action. Probably the best single reason to own a Saturn.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Warlords</td>
<td>Atari 2600</td>
<td>The game people played at parties when there was no  Bomberman. Up to four players use the paddles to repel a ball from their castle walls and protect their king, while trying to take out their opponents. A fantastic game.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Williams - Arcade's Greatest Hits</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>Emulated versions of 6 classic arcade games - Defender, Defender II, Joust, Robotron (yes!), Sinistar, and Bubbles. Any one of the above could bring you many sleepless nights.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Wipeout XL</td>
<td>Sony Playstation</td>
<td>Although not as much of an improvement gameplaywise as I'd hoped, I guess Wipeout would be hard to improve upon. WOXL does offer 8 tracks, an even faster pace, lightsourcing, new weapons, and some new special effects. Buy it!</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Yoshi's Island</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>My only gripe with this game is the silly timer, which basically  renders you impervious to all but pits. Aside from that the gameplay is good. Colorful graphics and incredible special effects.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Zelda - A Link to the Past</td>
<td>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</td>
<td>By no means as addictive as the first Zelda, but it's still a blast  the first time through thanks to the beautiful graphics and intriguing puzzles. Why's the second world have to be so dreary, though?</td>
