Diana's taking some Benadryl in to Lenny's school - he's breaking out in a rash.  Evidently he's inherited his grandmother's allergy to... <a href="http://allergies.about.com/od/urticariahives/a/solarurticaria.htm">sunlight</a>.  The last time this happened was after the Ren Faire, and yesterday was Water Day at school.  He was outdoors at midday for a prolonged period for both events.

I'd say no way this was the case, if his grandmother didn't have it as well...  Hopefully we'll be disproven over time.
