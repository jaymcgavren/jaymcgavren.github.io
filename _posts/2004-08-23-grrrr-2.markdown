My technical design document:

If the file cannot be opened, call the Error method of the Log Manager with the message "Could not open [file name] for reading." and return an error value.

The Indian developer's code:

$log-&gt;error("Could not open [$file] for reading and return an error value")

Look, I'm impressed that they know as much English as they do (by and large).  But that doesn't mean they know enough to be used for outsourcing.

And then they're making mistakes that I wouldn't make no matter *what* my native language is.  Here's one example:

elsif(($response =~ /HTX000F0/) || ($response =~ /HTX160F0/) || ($response =~ /HTX000F0/) || ($response =~ /HTX161F0/) || ($response =~ /UTX1XXF0/) || ($response =~ /HTX000F0/))

Never mind the illegibility of that statement for a moment; why did they test for the same value *three times*?

It would have been a *lot* easier (and cheaper) to just code this myself.
