Not too impressed with SCIV thus far...  I mean seriously, <em>ONE</em> real new character?!  (And no, I'm <em>not</em> counting Algol, and certainly not effing Yoda.)

My wife of course loves the elaborate dress-up mode, and I'll enjoy online play if it works properly.  But the new character designs are horrible, the 360 controls (at least) are frustratingly unresponsive, and I'm just overall unimpressed after the smorgasbord that was SCIII.
