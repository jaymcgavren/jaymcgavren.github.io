There's this screen saver that IT has installed on all desktops here (except mine :) that reminds us of our new corporate values.  (Apparently, we didn't have any before.)  Everyone hates it, because they can't disable it, it slows background processes to a crawl, and it looks butt-ugly.  And now, there's a new problem.

From a company-wide e-mail I just received:

&gt; You may have experienced some issues with your screen saver
&gt; giving an error that the “15 Day trial period of the
&gt; software has expired”. We are aware of this issue and will
&gt; have it resolved shortly and a new screen saver deployed to
&gt; all systems by end of business tomorrow. In the interim,
&gt; simply clicking OK will activate the screen saver.
&gt;
&gt; To assure that you receive the new screen saver, please log
&gt; out of your system at the end of business today and
&gt; tomorrow so the update can be loaded onto your system
&gt; during the next reboot.
&gt;
&gt; We apologize for any inconvenience that this may have
&gt; caused you, If you have any questions or concerns please
&gt; contact the IT Help Desk @ extension [XXXX].

Yes, that's right, we use unregistered shareware to communicate our corporate values.  :)
