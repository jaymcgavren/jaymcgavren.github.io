<a href="http://jay.mcgavren.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/trailsview.png" title="TrailsView"><img src="http://jay.mcgavren.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/trailsview.thumbnail.png" alt="TrailsView" align="left" hspace="10" /></a> I was having problems over the weekend with my more-modular GTK view, but I got things figured out.  A little more tweaking got me color and even trail widths.

Now all that remains is movement logic, which doesn't even need to be part of the main libraries.  (API users will pass control Procs in when they create their game objects.)
