Learned about <a href="http://www.alice.org/">Alice</a> last night; it's Carnegie-Mellon's 3D cousin to MIT's <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> development environment.  Alice is aimed at older students, and a bit more flexible.

I showed off the built-in library of objects to Diana, and the moment she saw the ocean-themed section, to my surprise, she all but elbowed me away from the keyboard.  (She's not a developer, but she is a fish nut.)  Thirty minutes later, and with only occasional guidance from me, she had a school of fish robotically spinning, rolling, and moving about an ocean floor.

Drag-and-drop is definitely a good way for novices to get started programming.  It's all too easy for a beginner to give up when all they get is a blank screen due to a well-hidden typo.  Mistake-resistant constructs you can scramble around and get instant feedback on keep a student moving forward.
