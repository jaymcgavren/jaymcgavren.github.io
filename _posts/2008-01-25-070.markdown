Published the new Zyps on Wednesday...

<blockquote>This is a major release for Zyps. Most important is the switch from the Ruby-GNOME2 to WxRuby, which is available as a gem. This means no more manual installation of dependencies before you can run the Zyps GUI. (And a nice little rendering speed boost, too.)

Behaviors now act upon all eligible targets in a single update, as well. This means more flexibility for your Actions and Conditions.</blockquote>

What I don't mention there is the feature I'm most pleased with - window resizing.  I'd intended from day one to have the playfield expand with the window, but I'm just now getting around to implementing it.

It wasn't as bad as I'd feared, but it was still kinda tricky.  And I need to do an 0.7.1 release tonight: Alex Fenton notified me resizing wasn't working right on OS X.  (Actually, I'm just grateful it's running at all on OS X, since I don't have a machine to test it on.)  Anyway, Subversion HEAD should be fixed as of last night, and I'll roll it out ASAP.
