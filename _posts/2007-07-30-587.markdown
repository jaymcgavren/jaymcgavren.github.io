Diana's friend is on a diet.  Diana's on a diet to support her.  I'm on a diet to support Diana.  Let's keep the chain going - anyone want to keep me company in my misery?  :)

Atkins shakes, light-meat poultry, sugar-free Jello.  Little fat and absolutely no sugar.  It's actually tolerable food-wise, but I'm finding myself lethargic and a little dizzy in the evenings.  Hopefully that'll balance out over time.
