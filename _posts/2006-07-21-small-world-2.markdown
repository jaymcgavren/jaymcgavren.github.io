For some reason it took me until today to realize that my new project does exactly the same thing as my last major project at my prior employer.

Different programming language.  Talks to different vendors.  (For now.  An upcoming enhancement might work with one of the same systems as the old project.)  Different communication protocol.  But it does the same damn thing.
