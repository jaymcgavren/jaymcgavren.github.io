Someone had left a copy of Soul Calibur II on the shelf in front of me at Target, and I finally decided to stop stalling.  I showed the screenshots to Diana, saying "This is the game I told you about that's similar to Dead or Alive 2.  Interested?"  Her answer was a giddy "Yes!", so into the cart it went.

She's a bit of a button masher, but she's actually getting pretty good.  After playing the section of the quest mode that requires you to parry to defeat your opponents, she can deflect a few of my attacks now.

DOA Ultimate's Live support was awesome.  Why, oh why don't more fighting games have online capability?
