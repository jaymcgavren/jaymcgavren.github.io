A shame that I never really listened to this song closely before - it could have been a theme song for the past 3 months.

&gt; Look at the earth from outer space
&gt; Everyone must find a place
&gt; Give me time and give me space
&gt; Give me real don't give me fake
&gt; Give me strength, reserve control
&gt; Give me heart and give me soul
&gt; Give me time, give us a kiss
&gt; Tell me your own politik

-Coldplay, "Politik"
