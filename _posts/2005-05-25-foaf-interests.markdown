So I've been listening to the new Prefuse 73 album, and I hop on Google to do a little research.  I read he's doing a tour to support the CD, and it occurs to me to check to see if there are any Phoenix dates.

Holy crap, he was here *last night*.  :(  That was a chance that is unlikely to come again for some time.

I've been thinking for some time about a centralized system which you can tell about your interests in bands, movies, actors, games, whatever, and it will go out and find news on them for you.  I'm sure Prefuse 73 has a mailing list I could subscribe to that would have told me about the tour, but that's just one artist, and besides, it would have subjected me to huge amounts of spam from his label, possibly regarding unrelated artists.

No, I want a system that lets me build a list like this:
prefuse 73
david fincher
sonic the hedgehog
the pillows
...

And then keeps me informed on those topics, with a minimum of spam.  It could even update my LiveJournal and FOAF interests lists for me at the same time.

Fortunately, nowadays you can create an RSS feed that provides you with the results of a Google News search, and I think that could be used to build a prototype.  I think that little project will be going on my someday/maybe list.
