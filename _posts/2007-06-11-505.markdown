Verizon wants to lock us in for two more years, so we're eligible for subsidized cell phones again.  I could stand my crap cheapo Nokia no longer; we took the bait.

Mine will be the <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/lg-vx8300/4505-6454_7-31812933.html">LG VX8300</a>, hers the <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/motorola-razr-maxx-ve/4505-6454_7-32432738.html">Razr Maxx VE</a>.  They're due to arrive tomorrow.

Only my line was eligible for the "new every two" discount, but she wants the more expensive phone, so I ordered each under the opposite line.  I called Verizon to confirm we could switch assigned numbers on the phones, so hopefully that'll go off without a hitch.
