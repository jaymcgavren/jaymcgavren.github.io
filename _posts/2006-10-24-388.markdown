Since I don't really like laptop keyboards, I was using Remote Desktop to copy my config from Midori to Lappy 486.  It occurred to me that I'd need a way control Midori from Lappy as well, so I set up VNC on Lappy and went to test it, forgetting that I was attempting to control to PC that was controlling Lappy...

You know the effect you get when you stand between two mirrors, how the reflections stretch away into infinity?  Yeah, it was like that.  I had to close Remote Desktop and break the loop to regain control.
