My proposal for Ignite Phoenix on November 3rd:

<blockquote>Scratch is a free visual programming language for kids created at MIT.  It lets kids as young as 5-6 easily create interactive stories or games and share them on the Web.  It's also easy to teach - just set machines up and turn the kids loose!</blockquote>

A member of the Ignite steering committee was among the parents that brought their kids to my June 6th class, so hopefully they're half-sold on the idea already.
