I hateHaTeHATE this framework!!!!  I initialized several data sets repeatedly for safety, because if I failed to at any point, they would silently return empty lists.

Well, the repeat initializations are hitting the database repeatedly and redundantly.  So instead, I have to scramble around the bits of this 1500-line class (which I didn't want to make that big, but had to for overhead reasons) and regroup the updates by data set.  All while my boss is (still) tapping his foot.

Eclipse is running so goddamn slow under the weight of this gigantic library that I can't go to declarations.  Hell, I can't even type without a 10-second delay.

I just...   ErrrrrRRRRAAAAGGGGHHHH!!!!
