Just grabbed new albums from Daft Punk, The Chemical Brothers, and The Prodigy, and I have to say I'm really disappointed.  These people all used to be gods in my eyes: makers of the loudest, angriest, most addictive music I've ever heard.  But on each of their latest releases, maybe one or two songs are enjoyable, a handful more are tolerable, and the rest is cliched or unlistenable crap that makes me reach for the "next track" button almost immediately.  Add this to Orbital's dismal Blue Album (reported to be their last), and it's shaping up to be a sad year for electronic music.
