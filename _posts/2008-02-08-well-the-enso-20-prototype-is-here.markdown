Here's <a href="http://humanized.com/weblog/2008/02/05/enso-20-prototype/#more-113">the article</a>...

Basically, everything that used to be [capslock][command-name] {arguments}/[capslock] is now [capslock][command-name]/[capslock]{arguments}[enter]/[enter].  About the only part I like so far is that {arguments} can have shift-characters now.

Perhaps I'm being hasty, but perhaps not.  Full impressions in a few days.
