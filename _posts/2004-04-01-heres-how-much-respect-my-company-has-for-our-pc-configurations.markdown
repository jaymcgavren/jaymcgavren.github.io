Just got this company-wide e-mail from our Manager of Corporate Communications...

&gt; It's easier than ever to access the important information
&gt; stored on [corporate website], because [corporate website]
&gt; is now the default home page for everyone's browser.
&gt;
&gt; Please be advised that if you change your default page,
&gt; [corporate website] will reset itself as your default page
&gt; every 90 minutes. (No, that's not an April Fools prank,
&gt; it's by design.)

When management needs to reassure everyone that IT policy is not, in fact, an April Fool's joke, you know you're in trouble.

Good thing I use a different Web browser than the rest of the company.  :)
