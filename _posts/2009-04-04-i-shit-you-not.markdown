Was sitting at a red light when I remembered that I needed to look into GitX (thanks for the tip, Byron and Andrew).  So I commit a minor no-no and flip out my cell to send myself a voice-to-text note via jott.com.  As I'm doing so, the cross-street's light changes, and I step on the gas.  That's when I realize my light <em>hasn't</em> changed.

Fortunately it was late at night, so there was no traffic to have an accident with.  But I <em>did</em> find this message in my e-mail:

<blockquote>
Jott Networks to Jay:

Reminder. Computer research Getex(?). Wooh! Jesus!
</blockquote>
