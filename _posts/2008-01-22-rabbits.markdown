About 24 hours after Alex Fenton (wxRuby maintainer) stated his intention to do a demo in Zyps, a complete "rabbit simulation" was sitting in my inbox.  (With Behavior remapped to Behaviour, and Color to Colour. :)  The little critters run around, eat grass, breed, and die, all in 300 lines of code.

This is exactly what I wanted out of Zyps - someone sees it, gets inspired, goes on a mad hackfest, and in a minimal period of time has a finished "game".  Hopefully once the library is sufficiently polished, many more people will be doing the same.
