The baby is currently seeing or needs to see the following types of doctors:

-Neurosurgeon
-Plastic surgeon
-Neurologist
-Geneticist
-Urologist
-Ear/Nose/Throat specialist

The most serious problem is that a "suture" between the plates in the front of his skull fused prematurely and can't grow properly.  They'll need to open it up and insert a piece of donor bone.  This doctor has a 0% rate of major complications over 17 years, but it's still majorly scary.

When they're done, he'll be normal and healthy.  But this is going to be a very stressful and expensive year.
