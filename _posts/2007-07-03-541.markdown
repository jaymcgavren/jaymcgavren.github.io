"There are two kinds of pains in the ass: the obnoxious boor - to be avoided on all teams - and the person who never learned that grownups shouldn't ask 'Why?' all the time. The latter is a treasure."-Dave Thomas, on selecting job candidatesI'm sitting in on a job interview this afternoon, so I'm looking into interviewing techniques, and this quote caught my eye...  (This is Dave Thomas of the Ruby community, not the fast-food community.)
