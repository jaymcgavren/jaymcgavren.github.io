Our last calendar update made it such that reminders are off by default.  I turned mine on, but when someone else schedules the meeting I can be pretty much assured it's off.  No reminder means I won't be at the meeting, which means embarassment in front of my boss.  Not acceptable.

Fortunately, Ruby's OLE bindings made a workaround easy.  I pass the output of this script to my "alert" program and set the whole thing up as a scheduled task.  If there are future meetings with no reminder, I'll have a warning sitting on my desktop as soon as I log in.

{% highlight ruby %}
#!/usr/bin/ruby
require 'win32ole'
require 'date'

#Set up constants.
CALENDAR_ID = 9

#Establish control of Outlook.
outlook = WIN32OLE.new('Outlook.Application')
mapi = outlook.GetNamespace("MAPI")

#For each appointment on calendar...
calendar_items = mapi.GetDefaultFolder(CALENDAR_ID).Items
calendar_items.each do |appointment|
  #Show future appointments with no reminder set.
  unless appointment.ReminderSet or DateTime.parse(appointment.end) < DateTime.now then
    puts ["No reminder:", appointment.Start, appointment.Subject].join("t")
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
