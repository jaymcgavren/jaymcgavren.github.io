Wow.  Was browsing the new Top 100 on Google Video, and they had a gameplay video of Will Wright's _Spore_.  I'd heard it mentioned on the 1UP podcast, so I checked it out - this is *amazing*.  I'm not even going to spoil the video for you, except to say that this is probably the deepest game in existence.

You can share your creations with other players, so I hope all of you will get it, too.
