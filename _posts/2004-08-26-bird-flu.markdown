High on my worry list these past few months - <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/ap/20040826/ap_on_he_me/flu_pandemic">bird flu in Asia</a>.  Few remember the strain in 1918 that killed 20 million worldwide, but if bird flu mutates into a strain that can infect people, the death toll could be higher this time.  And if Diana's working in a hospital at the time, odds are she's gonna bring it home.

Guess all we can do is stay healthy, get vaccinated every year, and hope for the best.
