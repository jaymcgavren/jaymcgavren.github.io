Here's some important stuff I have learned the hard way, or have read and believe to be true.

Be cool.
Be nice.
Winners focus.  Losers spray.  [Not mine.]
No matter how far you've gone down the wrong road, turn back.  [Not mine.]
People are selfish.  Projects that fight this fail.  Projects that harness this succeed.
10% of people are assholes.  10% of people are really nice.
Be brief.
Latency happens.  [Not mine.]
Failure happens.
Maliciousness happens.
The last 20% of the work requires 80% of the effort.  [Not mine.]

There's probably more to be added here...
