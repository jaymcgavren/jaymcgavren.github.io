There's a travel freeze and a hiring freeze (despite the fact that our department is severely understaffed).  They've just announced that they're halting 401K matching for the rest of the year.

Right now, I'm just hoping I get a severance package if I'm laid off.  We need it to sustain us while I hunt for a job.
