Time for the annual birthday celebration for the girls at First Round Draft.  The playlist at this point:

Jay and Diana: Barenaked Ladies - Call and Answer
Jay and Katrina: Scorpions - Wind of Change
Diana: Counting Crows - Round Here
Diana and Holly: Prolly some Dixie Chicks song
John: Ensuring his request slip mysteriously disappears from the queue so he doesn't have to sing

Diana hasn't done any singing for months, nor have I.  We should've been practicing for the past week, but 24 hours will have to do.
