From the e-mail I sent my family last night...

&gt; Diana's surgery to remove her gall bladder was today.  They
&gt; were able to do it laparoscopically (just 4 small incisions
&gt; for a camera, light, and tools), so she's in much better
&gt; shape than if they'd cut her open.  She didn't even need to
&gt; stay in the hospital overnight.  She's a bit sore, but
&gt; otherwise none the worse for wear, and she should have most
&gt; of her normal routine back in a few days.

That was all I had energy to do before I crashed.  (NyQuil is the devil.)

Diana's mom had already arranged to stay home and watch her, which is a good thing, because Lenny's also home from school with a 105-degree fever (same bug I have, probably).  Diana's in no shape to watch him herself, and I can't really take off work.

I can't wait until I'm established in this job, and have actual vacation and sick time.
