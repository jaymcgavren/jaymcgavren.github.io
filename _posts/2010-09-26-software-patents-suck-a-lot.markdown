At <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/uspto-bilski-guidance">the behest of the Free Software Foundation</a>, I just fired off an e-mail to the USPTO:

...That part was from the heart.  And then, not sure of the finer points of Bilski v. Kappos, I pretty much plagiarized their talking points for the rest.

I actually don't favor completely eliminating software patents.  But the current system is broken, and frankly, it has developers everywhere shackled.  If my options are to keep it as-is or throw it away altogether, I'll choose the latter.
