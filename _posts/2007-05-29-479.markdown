Finally made curry rice for Diana.  She loved it, but man, I'd forgotten how much effort it was.  Even with the (awesome) new knife set, cutting up the chicken and all those vegetables took nearly an hour.

I'm here at work chomping on (some of) the leftovers, though, and it's still good.  I have to remind myself that I wouldn't have leftovers with fast food, and I'd still spend nearly as much time going and getting it.
