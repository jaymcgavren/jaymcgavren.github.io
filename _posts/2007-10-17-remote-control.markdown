Whew!  Finally got two machines talking to each other over dRb.  Using the URL generated by the server was what finally worked.

The communication is perfect, too - the creature controller lives entirely on the client side, and the server just polls it for what to do with each update.  Any code at all could be running on the other end, meaning you can make the creature do anything you want.  (Now I just need to ensure that "any code at all" doesn't include malicious code.)

This isn't efficient in the least.  Two connections from the same machine works fine, but it does slow down.  I'm not sure what will happen with 10.  But I've made zero efforts at optimization, so it's time to start on that.
