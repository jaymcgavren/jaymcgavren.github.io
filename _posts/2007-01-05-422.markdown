The call:
&gt; CodeConvDAO(transaction).get(code, system.toString(), context.toString())

The declaration:
&gt; public CodeConvRecord get(String sysCode, String context, String code) throws DAOException {...}

...Even without knowing Java, you can probably figure out what's wrong with the call.  (Hint: the order of the parameters.)

So of course I don't see it until the moment my co-worker arrives at my desk to help me troubleshoot...
