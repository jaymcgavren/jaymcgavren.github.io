So, I logged onto the Zyps forum today and saw hundreds of posts.  I was very happy - had the forum finally been discovered?  Well it had, by spam bots.  They had created dozens of accounts, and the posts all had links to nonsense prescription drug sites of the same sort I'd been seeing in my blog comments.

PHPbb has "mods" to combat spam, but you have to manually edit the source files to apply them.  I'd happily do that once, but I'm not re-editing every time I install a new version.  Time to look for alternatives, I think.
