Anil Jain of Slipstream Labs came to Gangplank today for a brown bag talk.  Here are my notes:

<pre>
Ideas are a dime a dozen - it's ability to execute that's key.
People matter most.
        They are root cause of failure (or success).
        Motivators vary, weaknesses vary.
        Be careful who you choose to collaborate with!
        Misconstrued expectations are a key danger.
Risk is inherent in every decision you make.
        Ask questions of others who've done it before
        Don't rush into anything.
        What are tradeoffs in a decision?  Write down pros and cons.
Failure is necessary.
        Learning the hard way helps future decisions.

Machiavelli:
        "It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take
        in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success,
        than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.
        Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well
        under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do
        well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the
        opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the
        incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they
        have had a long experience of them."

Important abilities:
        Healthy tolerance for ambiguity.
                Change is constant, especially if you're the one bringing it
                about.
        Foster belief.
                Get others on board with your idea.
                        Employees, attorneys, the media, and more.
                        It's the difference between having people help you and
                        facing closed doors.
                        If you don't believe in the idea yourself (if you're in
                        it for the money), you won't convince anyone.
                Conviction is not Arrogance.
                        Entrepreneurs need a certain amount of stubbornness,
                        but if you don't respond to outside feedback, you'll
                        fail in real-world conditions.
Glamour is fleeting.
        The initial excitement wears off quickly.
        You need perseverance to last through the hard/painful parts.
        Even if people tell you, you won't understand HOW hard it is till you
        do it.

Kurt Vonnegut:
        "I want to stand as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out
        on the edge you see all the kinds of things you can't see from the
        center."

Drama is inevitable.
        The future is ambiguous.
        People are illogical and unpredictable.
        Drama is the result - be prepared.
        Example:
                A founder was expressing doubt to investors behind the backs of
                rest of board.  Rest of board didn't know why investments
                started slowing, and when they found out they had to work to
                restore faith.
Your personal life:
        At some point in time, your family/friends will NOT understand what
        you're doing.
        Supportive or no, they will eventually question your plan.
                Especially when doubt is introduced by money shortages,
                partners leaving, etc.
        It's not their fault - you need to keep the faith and get them back on
        board.
        Work/life balance is a myth.
                The two cannot be separated for an entrepreneur.
                Being an entrepreneur is a <em>life choice</em>.
                        You'll be checking your Blackberry while changing
                        diapers.
                The list of things to do will grow just as fast as you complete
                items (or faster).
There is <em>always</em> work to do.
        If you're asking yourself "what do I do now?", you're missing
        something.
        Tasks you can always do more of:
                Analyze competitors.
                Seek more funding.
                etc.
        If you don't want to be involved with this business the rest of your
        life, either don't start it, or have an exit strategy.
There is no formula.
        Anyone trying to sell you one is lying or delusional.
        Instead, rely on common sense.
        Learn lessons from others, but don't copy verbatim.
                You should not necessarily do <em>everything</em> Michael Dell
                did (but feel free to borrow some ideas).
Capital
        How much do I need?
                What resources do I need and how much will they cost?
        What types and sources should I seek?
        What am I willing to do to get it?
        Customer funded development:
                Give a customer a good deal, with contract that you keep
                ownership of developed product (or portions thereof).
Professionalism matters.
        It's good to be scrappy and get things done on a shoestring.
                But you have to be professional.
        Maintain standards of quality:
                In product.
                In communications.
                        With customers.
                        With vendors.
                        With investors.
Instinct alone is dangerous.
        Be aware of what your gut is telling you - we are animals that run on
        instinct.  But it should only be part of decision making process.
        You may miss feedback that shows reality of situation.
Partnering is a double-edged sword.
        Gives you access to partner's contacts, skilled workers, etc.
        But you give up control, more communication overhead, etc.
If any company has right of first refusal on your business, no other company
will invest in the research needed to buy you.
        If other company decides they like you, company with first refusal
        would just buy you.
Open source software may not be for you.
        Unless your chief goal is philanthropy...
        Capitalism is good, understand it.
        You've invested time, money, and research on a product.
                You and your shareholders should get a return on your
                investment.
        What is the objective benefit to us?
        What are we in business for, and does this deal fulfill those goals?
Simple microeconomics principles provide guideposts.
        Opportunity cost
        Price the market will support
        Value proposition to potential customers
Greed kills.
        It leads to bad decisions.
        Asking too much.
        Not offering enough in return:
                To investors.
                To customers.
Know what you know.
        Know your strengths.
                Helps you sell to investors, customers.
        Know your weaknesses.
                Get partners who are stronger in those areas.
In a strong wind, even turkeys can fly.
        Any company can succeed when economy is strong.
        Almost any partner is good enough when cash flow is good.
                More skills and dedication are needed when you encounter
                trouble.
        Hire slowly, fire fast.
Hiring - Past success not indicator of future potential.
        Partners that worked well in prior jobs may not work well with
        <em>your</em> company.
                Do they believe in your product?
                Will they work well with your investors and partners?
A customer in the hand is worth a thousand in the plan.
        Attractive to investors.
        Shows proof of what you're selling.
