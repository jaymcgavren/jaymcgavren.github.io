I brought some SNES games to Heatsync Labs' Vintage Game Night in Mesa tonight...

Attendee: "Cool, Tetris Attack?  You guys should be playing this one."
Me: "You show excellent taste, sir.  I bet you'll appreciate this..."  [I reach into a box to retrieve my prized Japanese import...]
Attendee: "Oh, did you bring Panel de Pon?"

...There's no impressing anyone any more.  :P
