Here we go...  ruby-prof said wxRuby was spending a lot of time initializing memory device contexts (canvases to draw on)...
<pre>
 %self     total     self     wait    child    calls  name
 45.42      5.63     5.63     0.00     0.00      120  Kernel#sleep
  8.85      2.05     1.10     0.00     0.95    28440  WxRubyStyleAccessors#method_missing
  5.16      0.64     0.64     0.00     0.00     9520  <strong>Wxruby2::MemoryDC#initialize</strong>
  4.42      5.14     0.55     0.00     4.59     9520  Wxruby2::Bitmap#draw</pre>
  
That would be because I was doing so before <em>each</em> line I drew.

{% highlight ruby %}
	def draw_line(options = {})
		buffer.draw do |surface|
			surface.pen = Wx::Pen.new(
...
		end
	end
{% endhighlight %}
	
So as a quick fix, I'm queueing my shapes and drawing everything at once.  This brought me about in line with Ruby-Gnome2, speed-wise:

{% highlight ruby %}
	def draw_line(options = {})
		@line_queue << options
	end

	def render_lines
		buffer.draw do |surface|
			while options = @line_queue.shift do
				surface.pen = Wx::Pen.new(
...
			end
		end
	end
{% endhighlight %}

<pre>
 %self     total     self     wait    child    calls  name
 69.41     11.27    11.27     0.00     0.00      240  Kernel#sleep
  4.24      1.83     0.69     0.00     1.14    30600  WxRubyStyleAccessors#method_missing
  2.96      4.17     0.48     0.00     3.69      480  Wxruby2::Bitmap#draw
  2.41      0.39     0.39     0.00     0.00    40640  Regexp#===</pre>

Though I made a pretty big memory structure to do it.  I'll have to slim that down at some point.

Now it says it's spending a lot of time initializing colors (Colours?) and pens.  Will I have to cache those?  Hope not.
