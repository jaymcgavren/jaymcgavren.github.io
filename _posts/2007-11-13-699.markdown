The Zyps presentation went pretty well.  I got a lot of good feedback and encouragement.  James Britt got the GUI up and running on Kubuntu (something that had eluded me thus far).  Chris Matthieu wants me to record a screencast for <a href="http://rubyology.com">Rubyology</a>.  David Koontz vowed to steal my behavior/action/condition setup and use it in Railgun (if I don't steal his first).

Now if only it had been to a group of more than <em>eight</em> people...  The change in location (now at the Rising Tide Software office) is partly responsible, I'm sure; people either couldn't find it or didn't want to trek the extra distance.  Also, no one was able to connect to the dRuby server like I'd hoped.

Oh, well, it was a fun evening, regardless.  Note to self - next time you order the teriyaki mushroom burger, have 'em go easy on the teriyaki.
