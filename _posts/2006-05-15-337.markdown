There's a store called Half Price Books near my work that carries used media, including a small games section.  I found a copy of "Magix Music Maker" for PS2, and at $7 I figured I could just write it off if it sucked.

It doesn't - from an hour's work last night I have the skeleton of a damn catchy tune.  (I'll be spamming everyone with a link once it's polished enough.)

My success there inspired me to see what the MTV Music Generator franchise had been up to lately - another $7.50 on Amazon got me a used Music Generator 3 for XBox.  I'm still pretty proud of at least one of the pieces I put together on the Playstation original, so we'll see what can be done two versions later.
