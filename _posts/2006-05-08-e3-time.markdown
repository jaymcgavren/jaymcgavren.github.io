Here's the stuff that piques my interest right away:

XBox 360
-F.E.A.R.
PS3
-Virtua Tennis 3
-Virtua Fighter 5
Wii
-The Legend of Zelda
-Metroid Prime 3
-WarioWare
-Sonic the Hedgehog
-Metal Slug Anthology
PS2
-King of Fighters 2006
-Lumines Plus
-God of War II
-Final Fantasy XII
PC
-Reservoir Dogs
-Unreal Tournament 2007
PSP
-Lumines 2

Need to research:
-Army of Two
-Ridge Racer 7
-Tekken 6
-Rainbow Six: Vegas
-Super Monkey Ball titles
-Red Steel
-Battlefield 2142
-Dead Rising
-Lost Planet
-Medal of Honor Airborne

And while I don't really care about it, "Throne of Agony" for PSP sounds more like a case of constipation than a game.

Anything else I should give a damn about?  All others shall be ignored with extreme prejudice.
