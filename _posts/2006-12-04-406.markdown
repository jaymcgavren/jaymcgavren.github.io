Went to Death Cab for Cutie on Saturday, and it kinda restored my faith in humanity.  This was a huge crowd, comprised of mostly twentysomethings, and yet the asshole quotient was the lowest I've seen since Japan.  You could tell it just by looking around, and listening to how people were talking.  Even though we were outdoors, the guy next to us asked our permission before lighting a cigarette.  There were drinks, but no drunken hollering.

Guess it's just not the kind of music that assholes like to listen to.
