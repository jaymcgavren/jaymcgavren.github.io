Back from John and Lacey's wedding in Iowa.  Our schedule, as usual, did not include time for sleep.

The newlyweds, being but recently out of school, had to do things on the cheap.  Among other things, that meant taking care of the reception hall themselves, both setting up (we helped till 1:00 AM the night before the wedding) and cleaning up (we helped till 1:00 AM the night of the wedding).  Add in the Iowa State Fair the following day (Ruth wanted to take her granddaughter), followed by a long drive back to Omaha, and you have a recipe for exhaustion.  Sorry we didn't even attempt to see Omaha friends during the trip.  We knew there wasn't gonna be time, though.

John and Lacey are pretty darn cute together.  I've thought so throughout their four-year-long engagement, of course, but their uber-mushy vows just reaffirm it.  Here's wishing them many, many happy years together.
