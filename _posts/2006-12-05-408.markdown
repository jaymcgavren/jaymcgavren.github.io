It is with great glee that I watch the demise of Tower Records, because I can almost see the RIAA crumbling with it.

And it's all the sweeter because at 50% off, their prices are almost reasonable.  I picked up some Quantic and Cinematic Orchestra that I would otherwise never get without paying Amazon shipping.
