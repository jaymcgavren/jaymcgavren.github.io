As those of you subscribed to this journal saw, I have cross-posting to LiveJournal from WordPress working.  I'm tired of my blog sitting on a server I have no control over, especially when there's no proper export feature, so I'm just going to skip right over Vox and go to WordPress.  I can import all my LiveJournal posts thanks to ljArchive, I can finally post via e-mail, and everything will be copied back here for my LiveJournal friends as if nothing had happened.

They do Subversion hosting, too.  All my repositories currently sit on a second hard drive within my PC (the condition of which you read about in an earlier post), and they're all too big to burn to DVD.  They've got family photos, code, and records, so I'm pretty nervous to have them all in one place.  Hopefully a server in another city is far enough away.

Photo galleries and Rails are next on the "let's see what we can do with it" list...
