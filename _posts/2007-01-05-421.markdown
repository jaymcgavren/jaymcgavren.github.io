Finally found a real reason to keep those neodymium magnets at work (other than keeping them far away from disks and video tapes at home)...  My pen, binder clips, Penguin Mints, nail trimmer, and even a stapler are happily out of the way and yet easily accessible, stuck to the underside of the metal bookshelf in my cube.

These magnets may have just gone from useless curiosity to Life Tool in my book.
