So, looking up <a href="http://drhorrible.com">Dr. Horrible</a> last night led me to find a whole slew of great web video series:

<a href="http://www.watchtheguild.com/">The Guild</a>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yioJQFrqMXM">Retarded Policeman</a>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQmkDDCyXQ">Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show</a> (haven't fully watched this yet, but it seems promising)

I'll be keeping an eye on these to see if they monetize themselves successfully.  If even <em>they</em> can't, I'm declaring internet video still not ready for prime time.
