I'm at home for lunch, and I just had a guy deliver me a package...  for an address on 58th street.  I explained to him that I was on 56th, and the best he could muster in reply was "Oh.  Okay."  As he took the package and turned around, I had to stifle a laugh at the "Dependable Delivery" logo on his shirt back.
