So the ending for EarthSea was abrupt and rather crappy.  In fact, there were a lot of plot points and characters that weren't properly fleshed out, as the story rushed on to the next event.  Do the producers have attention deficit disorder or something?  Bad CG, too.

I'm noticing this as a general theme for SciFi original productions.  I mean, what do you expect when the average budget is $750,000?  But they'd been promoting this one for months; I actually had my hopes up.  Never again.
