Was listening to a recorded talk about helping tech types relate to ordinary people, and the speaker broke an ordinary person's life down into stages and priorities:

-Teenager: friends
-Twentysomething: sex
-Thirtysomething: family (friends drop off)
-Fortysomething: contribution to society

The speaker put particular emphasis on that point - I guess it's a common phenomenon for friendships to fall by the wayside once family enters the picture.  Most of us are squarely in that thirtysomething group now, and yes, our friends are taking a back seat.

I just want you all to know that I'm not going to disappear altogether, and I don't want anyone else to, either.  Family won't be the top priority forever.
