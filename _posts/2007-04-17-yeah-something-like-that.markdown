&gt; Jay, the award program question has arisen again.  I know
&gt; you are busy with [project x] and [project y] work.  Do you
&gt; have time to look this over and come by to discuss it?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We'll need to get some input from our technical team on
&gt; &gt; this one, since it was my understanding that the system
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; set up so that 2005 awards automatically expire on
&gt; December
&gt; &gt; 31, 2006 unless the property is a repeat winner in 2006.
&gt; &gt; Could someone please look into why the 2005 award winners
&gt; &gt; are still displaying award logos on [our].com?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Liz


I fished through my e-mail archive, and dug this out...

&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt;
&gt; [snip]
&gt;
&gt; If we were to update the business rule for these
&gt; properties, what would the timeline look like for making
&gt; the change (see below)?  [snip]  I realize this isn't
&gt; ideal, but it is urgent that we address the issue because
&gt; properties are noticing every time their award logo
&gt; disappears from the site.
&gt;
&gt; The business rules for the 2006 program are:
&gt; [xxx] winners with 2005 dates expire on 12/31/07
&gt; [xxx] winners with 2006 dates expire on 12/31/07
&gt; [yyy] winners with 2005 dates expire on 12/31/07
&gt; [yyy] winners with 2006 dates expire on 12/31/07
&gt; Please let me know how you think it would be best to
&gt; proceed.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Liz
