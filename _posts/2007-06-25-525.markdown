Diana tolerates the following things on a daily basis that only my immediate family and closest friends can (and then only occasionally), and I love her for it:

my squeaky-voiced impressions
my digital photography (which consists of snapping 50 jillion shots, often unposed, in hopes of getting a few good ones)
my bizarre sense of humor
my long-limbed klutziness

....there's more, but that's what comes to mind for now.
