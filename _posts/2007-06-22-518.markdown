The <a href="http://moo.com">MOO</a> mini-cards came last night; they're gorgeous.  They were no effort at all to create, too.  Kinda made me forget that I was dropping $20 plus $5 shipping on something I have no practical way to display or carry in my wallet.  They don't make frames for something that's half the size of a business card.

They'll probably wind up sitting in their box on the end-table, waiting for guests to flip through them and take one.  They point to <a href="http://mcgavren.com">mcgavren.com</a> on the back, so once I actually have a page up there, they'll be able to see all the rest of our photos.
