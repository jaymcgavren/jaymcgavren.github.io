Google Tutor points out that Google has <a href="http://www.googletutor.com/2008/10/31/google-shows-some-halloween-love-to-the-robots/">added a clause to their robots.txt</a>:

<pre>
User-agent: zombies
Disallow: /brains
</pre>

But it seems to me that there's not much to worry about, because when I access <a href="http://www.google.com/brains">google.com/brains</a>, I get:

<blockquote>
www.google.com/brains - does not exist.
</blockquote>
