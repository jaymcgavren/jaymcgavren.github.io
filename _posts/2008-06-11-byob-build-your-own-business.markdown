Listened to the Ben Curtis interview on the Rails podcast, and it just made the whole entrepeneur thing seem a lot less painful than I had imagined it.  I am very tired of spending my time making other people famous and rich, so I paid close attention.

My favorite bit was the suggestion that you didn't have to trade time to get money - develop a good enough product and you don't have to spend tons of time supporting it.  I'd kill for more time to spend on my own software projects (maybe even be paid for developing them).

I already have the ideas - not one but two software frameworks.  Now I just have to come up with a business model to support them, but I can't do that without a better understanding of the issues.  I need to actually read that Micro ISV (Internet Software Vendor) book that's been on my shelf the last 2 years.  Then I need to talk to my dad and/or Brian about the administrative side - learn where they have to spend the most effort.  From there, I'm hoping the lightbulb will come on by itself.
