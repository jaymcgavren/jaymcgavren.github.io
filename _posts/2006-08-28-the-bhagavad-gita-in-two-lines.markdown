Be cool.

Be nice.

Of course, if you don't know what "cool" or "nice" are exactly, or *why* you should be cool and nice, you may want to read the Gita:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1577311477/sr=8-1/qid=1156796610/ref=sr_1_1/002-5318582-2400826?ie=UTF8">Jack Hawley - The Bhagavad Gita: a Walkthrough for Westerners</a>

I heard it is one of the core texts of the Hindu religion, and encapsulates the wisdom of all India over thousands of years, so I picked it up.  And as long as you filter out the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo ("Atma", etc.), it really does seem like a recipe for better living.

But in an effort to drill that wisdom into harder-headed readers, the Gita does repeat itself quite a bit.  So if you don't purchase it, meditate on the above two lines.  No, seriously, close your eyes and think really hard about them, preferably once a day.  You'll come to many of the same conclusions the book does.
