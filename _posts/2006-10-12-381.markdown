You know, if I had never gotten into ROM hacking, I might have made a good genetic researcher...

&gt; MIT World Â» : DNA Mutation, Repair and the Environment

&gt; Samson wants to figure out how to protect cells against
&gt; carcinogenic effects in the environment, and whether a
&gt; tumor cell will be susceptible to treatment. She has been
&gt; painstakingly studying the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast
&gt; organism, trying to identify all the factors that determine
&gt; whether or not DNA damaging agents kill or mutate cells.
&gt; She interrogated each of this organism's 5,800 genes,
&gt; "asking one by one, which of you is making a product that's
&gt; important to helping a cell recover from damage." In what
&gt; was a "huge surprise," Samson learned that there are more
&gt; than 2,000 gene products involved in helping a yeast cell
&gt; repair itself, "from areas of the cell never suspected
&gt; before for being important" in this way.
