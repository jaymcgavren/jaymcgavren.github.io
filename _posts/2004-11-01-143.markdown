After 2 months, the transmission is going out on the car Diana's parents sold her.  (We got rid of her other car, because we thought it was going to break down sooner.)  Dealer's estimate to fix it is $2500.

Money was already tight, what with the loan we took out.  And my credit card is maxxed, so that won't be bailing us out this time.

I know we can come up with a solution.  I just doubt it will be a pleasant one.

[Edit: after I posted this, I looked at the subject of the previous entry.  Oh, the irony.]
