-It hampers searches later.  You might search for "database" and miss all the references to "db".
-It thwarts anyone for whom English is not a first language.  "Config" doesn't appear in Webster's, much less an English to Japanese dictionary.
-Even within the same routine, you lose time and concentration trying to think whether you used "char" or "chr".

The benefits far outweigh the time cost of a few extra keystrokes.  (Unless you can't touchtype properly, in which case you should learn.)
