&gt; "Now we look back on medieval peasants and wonder how they
&gt; stood it. How grim it must have been to till the same
&gt; fields your whole life with no hope of anything better,
&gt; under the thumb of lords and priests you had to give all
&gt; your surplus to and acknowledge as your masters. I wouldn't
&gt; be surprised if one day people look back on what we
&gt; consider a normal job in the same way. How grim it would be
&gt; to commute every day to a cubicle in some soulless office
&gt; complex, and be told what to do by someone you had to
&gt; acknowledge as a bossâ€”someone who could call you into their
&gt; office and say "take a seat," and you'd sit!"

This is an article about founding startups, by the way.  And in it, the author explicitly advises anyone with a family NOT to do so.

Dammit, dammit, dammit.

[Edit: Wait a minute...  who cares?  I'm more likely to get my name out there with an open-source project than with a startup anyway.]
