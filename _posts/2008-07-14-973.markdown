Sooo tired...  The baby actually does pretty good about sleeping in these days.  But knowing he could wake up at 4 AM the morning I'm scheduled for an interview or to give a talk makes me think twice when scheduling such things.

Maybe if he just went to a sitter's house by default when there's an important appointment the next day?
