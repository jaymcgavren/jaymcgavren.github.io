This isn't a good first experience for a new major revision of the app you use most...

<a href='http://jay.mcgavren.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/close_button.png' title='Close Button?'><img src='http://jay.mcgavren.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/close_button.png' alt='Close Button?' /></a>

I saw what was going on immediately, of course (assumptions about my config), but if even a small percentage of those 8 million downloaders get confused by this, it'd be better to just leave that friendly little message off.  (Personally, I'm sick of the welcome pages altogether, since I get one every time FF upgrades itself.)

Just had to point that out, because I'm used to better from the Firefox team.  Aside from that my initial impressions are positive; the interface looks cleaner, and <em>maybe</em> more responsive (that could be the placebo effect though).
