Found a folder in the Quicksilver catalog that was indexed to infinite depth, adding hundreds of (wrong) entries and blocking the correct ones.  I can actually use it now that I've fixed it.

Not being able to navigate without the mouse was actually stressing me out quite a lot.  Feels like I just surfaced for air.  <em>Gasp</em>!
