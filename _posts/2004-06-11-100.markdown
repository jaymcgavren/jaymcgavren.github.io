If you weren't watching the Five Days to Midnight miniseries this past week, they'll be rerunning it on SciFi Channel ad infinitum, so be sure to catch it.  The hero's nemesis is truly wicked, so other bad-guys-in-training (Mooph) should take notes.

In completely unrelated news: iTunes's Party Shuffle just went from playing The Prodigy (hardcore jungle) to Sal Severe's How to Behave So Your Children Will, Too.  I think I'm gonna have to take my audio books out of there.  :P
