...after spending a day home sick.  (Lenny was out sick with me - he had a fever of 103, which has since come down, though his cough is still terrible.)  I also just got over a case of the hiccups - that had been running for over 24 hours straight.  :P  (Well, except when I was sleeping.)

I had a bizarre dream this morning...  I was watching a trailer for a comedy by Pixar, that pitted God (the Hebrew one) against various figures from Buddhism in a barrel-chucking battle royale.  Pixar depicted Yahweh as a bit of a hillbilly, I must say.  :P
