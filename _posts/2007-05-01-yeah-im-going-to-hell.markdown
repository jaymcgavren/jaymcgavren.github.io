I'm responsible for watching the e-mail inbox for the reports production account, because we have all these old-school scripts with hard-coded e-mail addresses.  They frequently need updating when someone changes job roles or leaves the company.  I've even been changing several reports whose main recipient, John Smith (not his real name), died a few weeks ago.

So I really shouldn't be laughing at this message I received today...

&gt; ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
&gt; John_Smith@mycompany.com
