I copied my comment on my Enso 2.0 prototype problems to the Humanized blog, and got this reply from "Andreas":

<blockquote>
&gt; It also shows why adding complexity to the system is a Bad Idea. If bad design doesn't get you, entropy will.

Very true. And sounds like a Larry Wall quote. :-D
</blockquote>

They just posted <a href="http://humanized.com/weblog/2008/02/08/bugs-and-stubs/">a new version of the prototype</a>.  We'll see if it addresses any of my concerns.
