I just finished asking Diana what she thought about cancelling cable TV while the budget was tight.  (She was OK with the idea since she has Hulu.)  I come back to GMail and see this ad at the top:

<blockquote>TV Service Too Expensive? - www.DishNetwork.com</blockquote>

Oh my God, I thought, Google <em>did</em> develop mind-reading technology.

Well, no.  But they may as well have.  They probably displayed that because my last two sent e-mails were:

<blockquote>Reminder: Jobs: Next: Check Chase bank statement for payments to cancel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have to backtrack - it looks like the travel budget will be too tight in June.  Don't think we're going to be able to make it.  :(</blockquote>
