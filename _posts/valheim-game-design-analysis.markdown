Hopefully you've seen my [analysis of Subnautica: Below Zero](https://jay.mcgavren.com/2022/09/14/subnautica-below-zero-game-design-analysis.html). Here's a similar post with interesting design choices I noticed in my second playthrough of Valheim.

Note there are copious spoilers for the game throughout this post!

In the early game, rainy days are suboptimal days to go out adventuring, due to lowered visibility and difficulty staying warm (lowering stamina). But they might be ideal days to stay home and cook, or do other homesteading.

Raspberries, cloudberries, and blueberries grow only in their respective biomes, and cannot be farmed. These biome bound berries are essential for crafting various foods, which are essential for progress.

Draugurs will turn and run from you if you get them below half health. This can save your life, but can also be a problem if you need their drops. You also don't know just when they will return...

Wraiths provide strong incentive not to be in the swamp at night, when you're weaker. When you're stronger, they drop a necessary resource, giving an incentive to return.

Players could be walking over silver veins any time they explore the mountains biome. But as they're buried, it's impractical to find them without the Wishbone item retrieved from the swamp biome boss. The Wishbone alerts the player when they're in proximity to buried items (iron ore, silver ore, grave sites). Of these, only silver ore is uniquely unlocked by the wishbone.

Flax (yields powerful equipment) and barley (yields powerful food) won't grow outside the plains biome, requiring you to build a (separate) settlement there.
