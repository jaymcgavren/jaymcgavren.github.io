I followed Diana out into the living room.  I thought she was in the mood, which was good, but as I looked around I thought we were in a stranger's house, which was bad.  She was saying something to me insistently, but I have no clue what.

It was only after I'd already been fiddling with the cables for more than a minute that I realized we *were* at home, that Diana was actually asking me to fix the XBox, and that it was 3 AM and I was groggy as hell.
