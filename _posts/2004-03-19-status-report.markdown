-Diana's bracelet: Repaired.  They did a solid job; nothing short of serious trauma will harm it now.
-Diana's PC: Hard drive is going bad.  It's a relief just knowing for sure what the problem is, though.
-CSS: So simple a monkey could do it.  I won't need to devote much time to this.
-JSP: Ugh.  This stuff produces nothing but ugly code.  I'm not going to enjoy working with it much if I *do* land this position.
-Resume: Haven't touched it.

The resume, CSS, and JSP may be a moot point, though.  My bosses are talking about a project that may land me that spot in Product Development.  My name has already been mentioned once to the CTO, who showed some interest in what I've been doing down here in my current department.  And I can't pursue any of it if I go after the Professional Services position.

All I need here is a clear path to follow - is that too much to ask?
