Best Buy is offering a World of Warcraft map for $2 - shipping is free.  Pre-expansion, but it could be useful anyway.  Just ordered ours.

&gt; More than just a map, this giant lay of the land is a work
&gt; of art. At 24" x 36", this two-sided map makes a great wall
&gt; hanging in any room. On one face, the map shows all flight
&gt; paths, including the Horde, Alliance, Neutral and
&gt; Druid-only travel points. On the flip side is an unfettered
&gt; map of Azeroth displaying a beautifully rendered view of
&gt; the topography of the islands.

Popped next door to Target and bought a Burning Crusade box ($40) as well.  Lessee, and we're dropping, what, $30 a month to maintain two accounts?  Man, Halo 2 was a lot cheaper...
