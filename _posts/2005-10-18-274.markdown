Nobody around here had the new Boards of Canada album (well, Tower Records did, but I'm not paying $18 for it).  So I ordered it off Amazon and was resigned to not getting to hear it until the package arrived.

When I completed checkout, what do I see on the page?  "Now available in your Digital Locker: A stream of Boards of Canada - the Campfire Headphase."  My jaw dropped.  I had thought this whole Digital Locker thing was silly, until that moment.

Sure, it's a crappy 64K stream that only plays in Windows Media Player, but I'm in bliss right now listening to it.  This is a really good album, and it's gonna be even better on CD.  Thanks, Amazon.
