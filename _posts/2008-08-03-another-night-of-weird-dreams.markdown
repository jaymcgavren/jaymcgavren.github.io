In the first, I was an exchange student in Japan again, though certainly not the Osaka I remember.  The whole place was under police lockdown, and gangs were mugging students trying to get between campus buildings.

In the second (and <em>this</em> is the weird one), Diana and I were among a flock of birds living on a small island.  (Yeah, I know, I've never dreamed I was anything other than a human before.)  There was a dispute with the lions (yes, lions) on the island over the produce of the various fruit trees scattered about.  We wound up resolving things by agreeing to fly over to the other islands to eat, since the lions couldn't fly.
