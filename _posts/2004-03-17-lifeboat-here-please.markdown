Currently on my plate:

-Fix Diana's PC, which may simply need a reformat and reinstall, or may need a whole new hard drive.
-Finish the next chapter of Greenwood (probably the last before I quit), which is two months overdue.
-Chase after Ticketmaster for a refund, because they didn't send me my tickets for the Barenaked Ladies concert tonight (which we are now going to miss).
-Have Diana's bracelet (a gift from me, which broke shortly after I gave it to her) fixed.
-Update my resume.
-Learn CSS in the next 2 weeks.
-Learn Java Server Pages in the next 2 weeks.

...I expect to have maybe 16 hours in the next week in which to work on all this, and I'm sure more stuff will have piled on by then.

Help!

[Edit:] Well, strike one off the list - I got through to Ticketmaster, and they set us up at the Will Call window.  Yay!
Evidently they did the same thing to one of my co-workers for a few days ago.  :P
