OK, Campfire Headphase is getting old, and Trans Canada Highway was little more than a teaser.  Where is the next Boards of Canada release?

I haven't heard the loop on their <a href="http://www.boardsofcanada.com/discography.html">discography page</a> before - is that new?  (Yes, I really do need a fix that bad.)
