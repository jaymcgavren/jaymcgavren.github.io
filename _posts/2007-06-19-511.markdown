Damn, Parallels is only $80.  Being able to switch live between OSX, Windows and Linux would solve a lot of problems for me.  (Of course, it might also create new ones; I'm already stretched pretty thin maintaining my work, desktop and laptop configs.)

Was waiting for WWDC to see if they announced Mac mini upgrades.  Instead they announced Time Machine, which looks like the backup/versioning solution I've *really* been waiting for.  (Subversion works, but it ain't transparent.)
