What I wish was different:
-Carriage returns for lists (like this one) all got wrapped.
-No comments; I didn't realize they'd been left out until I was reading the book.
-Some page headers mis-aligned.
-Date format on cover; I could have fixed it via their import wizard but didn't.
-A dedication page or something; it launches right into content on the first page.

But overall, I'm <em>extremely</em> pleased.  It's less than ready for sale in Barnes and Noble, but it's more than a simple printout.  My photo thumbnails are all there, my impressions of Arizona from when I first moved here, my screenshots from Zyps development, even my entry from the night I first met my wife.

This is something I can leave behind for my grandkids to read.  Makes me wish I'd been blogging for longer than 5 years.
