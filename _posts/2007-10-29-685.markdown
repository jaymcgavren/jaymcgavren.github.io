I am, at the moment, pretty darn happy with my lot in life.

No, things aren't perfect.  But who's to say it would have been utopia anyway?  We're a lot better off than many folks.

Diana starts work again early next month.  Good thing, too - it was either bring in a second paycheck or start making lifestyle adjustments, 'cause our savings was slowly shrinking.  But this should let us start getting ahead.

Helped John and Holly move into their new place, meaning we didn't get our own housework done again this weekend.  Next weekend we go to see the in-laws' new place (but no heavy lifting this time).
