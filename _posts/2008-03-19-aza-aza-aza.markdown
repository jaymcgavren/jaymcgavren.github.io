<a href="http://bloxes.com/">Bloxes</a>.  A great idea that Aza Raskin should have sold to someone else to implement.

Look, I know all about distractibility, believe me.  I know about having more ideas than you could ever possibly do.  That's why you need to discipline yourself and <em>focus</em>.  Archy was a good starting place, and a good final goal.  Enso was arguably a necessary detour.  (But it's not making money any more, is it?)  The music search service was, well, what the hell was it?  And now you're breaking off into <em>manufacturing</em>?

I have the utmost respect for you and your work.  But if you spread yourself too thin, each of your projects is going to disappear the moment you turn your attention away from it.
