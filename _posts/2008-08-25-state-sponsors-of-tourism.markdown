We're finally sending updates to the vendor en masse, and there aren't many errors, but the ones that do come up are interesting...  For example, the spec has this phrase:

<blockquote>[We] will enforce U.S. Sanctions as required by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).  OFAC prohibits U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with certain sanctioned countries (such as Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Syria), organizations, and individuals deemed to be acting on behalf of, or located in, certain sanctioned countries, terrorism sponsoring organizations and individuals, and international narcotics traffickers.</blockquote>

I didn't concern myself with this much, as I doubted my own company would be doing business with anyone in North Korea.  So I was surprised when this error came back...

<pre>This property record has been rejected due to it being located in an OFAC sanctioned country.</pre>

...for a customer in the Cayman Islands.  I think the vendor needs to update their database...
