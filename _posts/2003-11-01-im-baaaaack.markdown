OK, mr_mooph (among others) wants to know what the hell is going on in my life, so I'm gonna give this blogging thing another shot.  Hopefully I'll be able to update a bit more frequently this time.

OK, so to bring everyone up to speed: My company's Omaha office closed in May, so that they had an excuse to fill their spiffy new Scottsdale, Arizona office with staff.  (Scottsdale's a Phoenix suburb.)  Since the Omaha job market looked pretty bleak, I reluctantly transferred down to Scottsdale.

The intervening months have been a whirlwind.  I realized I despise my new boss even more than I feared I would, and am currently doing double duty on a project with Product Development (programming) in an effort to get myself noticed by the head of that department.  (How that will work out is still up in the air, since I know they would like to hire me, but don't have the budget for any new people.)

My social life has been equally crazy.  I did the dating circuit at work, until I exhausted the office's supply of women whose IQ was bigger than their waist size.  Finally met a girl named Monica online.  We were really serious at first, and I still like her, but the relationship is kinda wavering.  Not sure how that's going to work out.

Unlike my old boss, I wouldn't dare ask my new one to let me rearrange my schedule around school.  I had this plan that I was going to take this big new salary and save until I could take a couple years off and go for my bachelor's.  Unfortunately, living in Scottsdale tends to eat through one's cash pretty fast.  A reworking of my finances is probably in order.  Schedules in Product Development seem much more flexible, too, so if I can get hired there, I'll be set.

Anyway, that's the past 6 months in a nutshell.  Further updates as events warrant.
