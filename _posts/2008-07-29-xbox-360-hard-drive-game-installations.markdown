&gt; Nope. Game can be played from hard drive, but you'll still need the game in
&gt; the drive to prove that you own it.

Not surprising, but disappointing.

I still want a generic CD/DVD/Blu-Ray rack that can be wirelessly accessed by any console, PC, or player in the house.  I want to purchase/burn something, drop it in a slot, and then forget I even have physical media for it.  Of course, this device will never be made, because the moment neighbors started sharing media, the manufacturer would get sued by media companies.
