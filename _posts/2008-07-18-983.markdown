Was gonna do a fake book cover for <em>Speaking LOL</em>, published by O'RLY, but in Googling for materials found that someone had automated the whole process (and that a LOLcats cover was one of their examples).  So I did this instead:

<a href="http://www.oreillymaker.com/link/18757/zyps/">Zyps: Game Development the Lazy Way</a>

The real book, less sarcastically titled, will be coming out as soon as someone gets me an O'Reilly editor's contact info.  :)
