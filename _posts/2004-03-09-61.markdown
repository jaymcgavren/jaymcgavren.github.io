Just got my copy of Links 2004.  Not too impressed with the graphics or the cheesy Matrix effects when you get a nice hit, but it's fun to play...

What I really enjoy, though, is playing a course that's just a few miles from Diana's house, with mountain ranges I see on my daily commute in the background.  Hell, I might even go play the real course (after a few trips to the driving range), just so I can see the differences between that and the game.  Dunno what it is, but I love seeing the real world pixelized.
