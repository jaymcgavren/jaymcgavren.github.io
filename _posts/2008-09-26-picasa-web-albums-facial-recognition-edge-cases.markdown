Finally!  Picasa Web Albums rolled out its facial recognition feature.  No equivalent for the desktop Picasa (yet), sadly.

It's fast, and accurate.  Some interesting bits:

-Most of the time, it has no trouble distinguishing between my pre-beard and post-beard face.
-It thinks my wife and my-wife-with-sunglasses are two separate people.
-It thinks my-wife-with-sunglasses and my-son-with-sunglasses are the same person.  :)
-Pictures of a rapidly-growing kid (age 3-5) seem to make it uncertain, though its "most likely" match is usually correct.
-Based on only one picture of my brother at age 26, it just picked out a picture of him at age 11!  (It wasn't certain, but he was the most-likely match.)
-A fake sneer or frown tripped it up (though again, the most-likely match was correct).
-A subject losing (or gaining) a considerable amount of weight makes it uncertain.
-The lighting on a face has to be REALLY poor to trip it up.
-Most-likely match was right even on a face that was ~20% blocked.
-Good guess on a face viewed through smoke (from a yellow smoke bomb).
-Two different women with similar makeup, facial expression and pose were sorted next to each other.  (And the second was mis-identified as the first, probably because she usually wears glasses and wasn't in this shot.)
-The best guess is usually of the same sex, but when it's tripped up, members of the opposite sex may outrank the actual subject for second- and third-best guesses.
-Subjects of the same (or similar) ethnicity tend to get grouped together.
-Sticking your tongue out is a good way to trip it up.
-Odd angles (like up from the floor) confuse it (badly).  Profile-views aren't as bad, though.
-(Obviously) cartoon faces occasionally find their way into the list.
-A short-lived goatee only throws it off once; after that the best guess is correct for further goatee pictures.
-Bangs partially covering the eyes throw it off.

I know some of these are "duh" items, but this has just made me appreciate what a hard problem facial recognition is.  Especially in the area of photos, where you're dealing with changes in age, weight, hair, expression, poor lighting, sensor noise, and a host of other problems.

Now, how can I sort the photos back on my hard drive, since Google and I have done all this work?
