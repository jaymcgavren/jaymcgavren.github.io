Typing this from our new Dell Inspiron 1501.  ("Mini Me".)  Got here via "open new journal entry", from my <em>speedily</em> working Enso installation, using a shortcut created by my working Ruby installation from a config file stored in my fully-preserved $home folder.  All without bluescreening once.

We still have 360 glorious days of warranty coverage, but just in case, I checked their out-of-warranty options - $160 to repair any problem outside of the mobo or LCD.

Lappy486 failed the very same week that its warranty ended, and Acer won't touch it.  We knew we were taking a risk on it, but damn, we didn't think it would go <em>that</em> badly.  Frankly, I'm done with all brands besides Dell and Apple until the field changes.
