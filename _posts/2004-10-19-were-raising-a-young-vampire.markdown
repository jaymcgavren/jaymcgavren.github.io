Lenny bit me on the shoulder a couple days ago, then smiled as if it was a joke.  A quick butt swat promptly informed him otherwise.  When he was done wailing, I sat him down to talk about why biting was bad.

I guess it didn't work.  We got an incident report from the daycare last night that he bit another kid "while blowing bubbles".  And then in the evening, impatient because his grandmother couldn't get a videotape playing, he smacked her in the hand.

Changes in staff at the daycare have left them short-handed, and Lenny also recently moved from the 1-year-olds' room to the two-year-olds'.  We figure both these things are causing stress.  But I also have to wonder what those kids in the 2's are teaching him.

My last theory is that it's all a cry for attention; we're simply not getting to spend much time with him at home.  So after things were settled down last night, we turned the TV off, went to his room, and just played with his toys for a while.  I intend to do more of the same whenever I can.  We'll see if that makes any improvment.
