I was reading an op-ed about the coming oil crisis when I had a thought.  A thought much broader than the energy crisis or the environmental crisis or the democratic process crisis or any of the other crises we face today.  And it's a thought that's been had before, so I'll just borrow the words it was phrased in before:

Necessity is the mother of invention.

Of course we're facing an oil crisis and an environmental crisis.  We haven't invented alternatives to fossil fuels, because it's never been necessary before.  Now it is, so we will.  Of course we're concerned about the lack of voter-verifiable paper trails.  But now that we've realized they're (still) necessary, we'll (re-)invent them.

Insert your favorite emergency here, and then relax.  As soon as people start dying from it, the solution is coming.
