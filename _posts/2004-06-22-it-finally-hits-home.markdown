I just learned that while I'll be doing the technical design for the new version of my GDS update program, coding work will be handed off to four coders in India.

Either I'm defining the role I'll have within the IT organization (strictly design, which is actually the fun part), or I'm training my replacements.  Until I know which, I'll be polishing my resume.
