Was listening to an old Slashdot Review which talks about the difficulty and expense a mechanic was having replacing a headlight on a new HHR.  Evidently in their efforts to reduce weight, car makers are often using lighter metals where you would normally expect steel.

Just as I arrived at work, I get a call from my wife - guess what just happened to her new HHR?  Well, no, not the headlight - she tore the roof antenna off with the garage door.  Hopefully this is a quicker fix than a headlight...
