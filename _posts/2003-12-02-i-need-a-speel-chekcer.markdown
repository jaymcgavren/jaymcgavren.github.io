I think I'm losing my intellectual edge as I get older...  The latest symptom is my spelling.  I used to be able to write dozens of pages without a single goof, but the past couple weeks, I've caught myself swapping "they're" for "their", backspaced over mistyped words and then mistyped them again the exact same way, and worse.  (And that's just what I've caught.)

Spelling isn't *that* big a deal, I guess.  Just please, please don't let my programming ability be next.
