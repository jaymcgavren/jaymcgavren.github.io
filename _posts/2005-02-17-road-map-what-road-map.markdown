I just got informed that later stages of my current project will be scrapped, and I have to come up with a way for my system to talk to a third-party company's database (a company who has consistently failed to deliver usable solutions in my experience).

If this succeeds, we'll have stopped multiple customers from leaving us due to unfulfilled contractual obligations, and I'll be a hero.  If this fails, it could end my fledgling career.  No pressure.
