Just hacked my way through a gnarled jungle of shell script, SQL, and 4GL in a single day.  (I'd never have been able to keep it all in my head otherwise.)  Feeling pretty accomplished.

Of course, a gnarled jungle of Java awaits me for the rest of the week as I try to design something that will play nice with my host app...
