Lenny asked to play chess again over the weekend...  He's no grand master, as we have to keep going over how the pieces move, but once he had it all in his head, he was actually thinking a move or so ahead.  Remember, this kid's only 4 1/2.

I actually credit a lot of my strategic thinking ability to the chess games I had with my Dad when I was young, so this is a great sign.
