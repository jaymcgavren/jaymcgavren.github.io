The new Flock browser inspired me to establish a del.icio.us account:

http://del.icio.us/nephariuz

I then went through my Google Search History and added everything that seemed worthwhile. It's mostly tech and development stuff, so I won't be participating in the shared account thing (haven't visited any J-Pop sites in forever), but if you're interested in such things, take a look.

Oh, and I was able to export everything from del.icio.us and import into Furl, too!

And THEN, I found I could use tools like this!
