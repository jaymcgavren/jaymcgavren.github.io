Started a GameFly trial last week.  My only complaints so far are that you can only have 50 games in your queue, and turnaround is somewhat slower than Netflix.  Otherwise, it seems like a pretty good service.  One game at a time will cost you $17 a month, or $22 for two.

Fable was the first item we queued.  Guess we'll be buying it; Diana's been playing four hours a night.  Her favorite pasttime seems to be tweaking her hairstyle and shopping for clothes, though.  Such a girl.  :)

I've decided I'll be an evil assassin.  (Got to love a game that gives you the freedom to decide such a thing.)  I'm guessing it's due to my evil ways that I'm slowly losing my hair (and not in an attractive way, either).  My character will look cool when he's totally bald, but for now he looks ridiculous.  :P

My allergies are driving me nuts.  Gonna stay long enough to keep my promise to meet Diana for lunch, and then I think I'm going home for the day.
