Our project architect wanted to track files in a database.  I would have been just as happy with a text file, but I put in a database to avoid an argument.  In my experience, arguing over an overly-complex design takes longer than doing it the complex way.

Now the database admin, who I was never even introduced to, is vetoing my design.  She says it's not efficient enough.  I say we're going to be writing 20 records a DAY to it.  She says "we might expand it in the future".

Whatever.  Arguing about it takes longer than doing it the complex way.  I'm hoping my boss sticks a sock in the admin's mouth before I start the redesign, though.
