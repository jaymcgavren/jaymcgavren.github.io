I feel betrayed in more ways than one.  Zelda is NOT supposed to have this dark shit going on.  (No, I won't offer any more spoiler than that.)

At least now I no longer feel a need for someone to remake Ocarina of Time with better graphics - Twilight Princess pretty much fills that void.  (It's pretty much charted territory, but at least it's a very solid game.)
