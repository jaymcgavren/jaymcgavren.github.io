Maybe I'll be navigating around Rails projects in a more coordinated fashion eventually, but right now I'm finding myself doing a full-project search for a string I saw in the rendered page somewhere.  I don't have to worry about whether it occurred in a template or a partial (or someplace else it really shouldn't be), I'm just taken to the right place.

Jef Raskin promoted tossing out folders and filenames and so forth in favor of just searching the text of documents.  He argued they're overhead that people don't use anyway.  And seeing the rise of Google and desktop search (not to mention witnessing my own behavior), I think I agree.
