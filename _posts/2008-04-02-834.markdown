I know that an analyst isn't going to be able to discuss projects on the same technical level as the nerds she's working with.  But we've got one whose understanding is <em>so</em> poor, she can only speak in generalizations like this:

"What should I label your task as?"  "Can I mark items 15-19 complete?"  "Is everyone in the meeting in agreement?"

I thought it was just her, but then in this morning's meeting a program manager (who I thought was more knowledgeable) was doing the same thing.  Is this really adding value to the discussion?
