All a developer should have to worry about is coding his API and *maybe* his user interface.  Networking, permissions, input, rendering to the screen - all of that should be taken care of for him.  He shouldn't need to worry about whether an object will be accessed from a PC, a cell phone, or a dumb terminal on the other side of the world.Because the moment he *does* worry about any of these things, the solution he comes up with is gonna be "wrong" from *someone's* perspective.
