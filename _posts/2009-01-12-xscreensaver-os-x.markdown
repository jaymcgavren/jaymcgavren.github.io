The OS X port of XScreensaver is simple, stable, and unobtrusive as far as I can tell.  Unfortunately you can't (easily) pipe program output into Phosphor and other textual screen savers, but other than that they're spectacular.

I did toss out some of the less impressive ones, though.  Here's what I kept installed:
