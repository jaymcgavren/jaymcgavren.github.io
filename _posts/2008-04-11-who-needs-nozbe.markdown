So I experimented with Nozbe for a while and then discovered that its main benefit was the next actions list, which could just as readily be replicated with a next tag in Gmail.

So I've got everything I can do as a next action on the Next tag there, and my Nozbe account sits unused.  Guess I don't need to spend that $5 a month.
