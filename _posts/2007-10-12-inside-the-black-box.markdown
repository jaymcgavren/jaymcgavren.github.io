Got an invite to a Google tech talk via the Java Users Group, and of course I was curious to see the inside of a Google office, so I went.  Pretty swank, even though they're just renting from ASU for now.  Wii and XBox 360 on an HDTV (I didn't play).  Cafeteria area with containers labelled things like "vegetarian" and "low-cholesterol" (and no cash register).

For the event itself - catered hors d'oeuvres and beer, door prizes for half the people in the room, swag bags for everyone.  (Diana and Lenny love their new flashing-LED Google pins.)

From Google's perspective, it's part of a recruitment effort, and I'm betting they're happy with their results - a turnout of over 100 people.  Some of these people had rather expensive degrees, too.  I wound up talking shop with a guy from Lowell Observatory (astrophysics PhD).  (I mentioned the tour we took earlier this year, and the guide who told us that Lowell has a program for deflecting Earth-bound asteroids (they don't, he confirmed :) .)

Josh Bloch was the speaker, and he had some very scary Java pitfalls to share with us.  At his recommendation, I made myself a note to research FindBugs (for the second time this year; I really need to get around to that).

Anyway, a fun evening all around.  They'll be getting Vint Cerf in January.  I'll definitely be there, for networking if not for the speaker.
