I bought Arovane's <a href="//phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=17508648">Lilies</a> off the iTunes Music Store last week (and then downloaded MP3s right after so I could listen in my car).  Apple is really doing a good job of signing smaller labels - Arovane's publisher is based in Germany.  Maybe someday I'll even get more of my music from the Music Store than I do from SoulSeek.

I've had "Cry Osaka Cry" looping through my head all day - I'm hooked pretty bad.  Fortunately, Arovane's music tends to stand up to repeated playing.
