Thanks to furl.net's popular links, I'm finding a great many people talking about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280">David Allen's Getting Things Done</a>.  It's basically a set of principles for keeping your life organized, and though a lot of it is stuff I discovered on my own, it really fills in the blanks.  I'm probably going to grab this book and see how much of it I can (readily) implement.
