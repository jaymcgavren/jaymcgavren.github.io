I dug out the archive of my old gaming site from 1999, and uploaded it here.

<a href="http://jay.mcgavren.com/ragegames">Rage Games</a>

No need to rely on GameSpy and their ads for hosting any more.  (Although it's still up at its <a href="http://classicgaming.com/ragegames">original location</a>.

There's a defunct <a href="http://jay.mcgavren.com/ragegames/videogames.html">game reviews section</a> of the site (it's not even linked from the main pages) that I'm trying to salvage.  For your amusement, I parsed out my favorites and posted them <a href="http://jay.mcgavren.com/blog/favorite-games">here</a>.
