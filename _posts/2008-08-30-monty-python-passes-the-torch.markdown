Just watched my first episode of The Wrong Door - it's like Flying Circus has been resurrected.  (With crappy CG!)

<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/">BBC Three site</a>

Only those with a U.K. IP address are <em>supposed</em> to be able to get to it, but there's some kind of fluke that makes it available right now.  I'm not gonna count on its release over here; watch while you can.
