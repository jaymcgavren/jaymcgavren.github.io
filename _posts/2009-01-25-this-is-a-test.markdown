To ensure everything is back to a normal state after my attempted WordPress updgrade earlier this evening (morning).  Oh, it all worked, but there were some minor glitches that would have taken too long to fix and would have annoyed the crap out of me.

My old install hasn't been turned into a spammer's link farm yet, so I'm rolling back, dammit.
