Since suddenly acquiring a family at home and being shoved into the bureaucratic dogpile at work, I feel like my life is always on fast forward.  I'm praised for my work in meetings and thanked for my efforts at home, and I know I can do what's being asked of me, but I don't feel in control of the situation anymore.  All I can do is dive in and give my best effort.

Well, I suppose this is what everyone goes through.  I never even kept a calendar before, so of course there will be a period of adjustment for me.
