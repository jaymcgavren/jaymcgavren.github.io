If you are reading this, odds are...

* You are one of the richest 5% of Earth's population.
* You live in the most peaceful era in human history.
* You are at least reasonably healthy, both mentally and physically.
* You have more educational materials, literature, music, and movies available to you, several times faster and cheaper than your parents did.

All of the above <em>are <a href="http://www.armscontrol.org/">threatened</a> <a href="http://overfishing.org/">on</a> <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html">multiple</a> <a href="http://www.overpopulation.org/">fronts</a></em>.

You need to realize immediately how unbelievably fucking lucky you are.  And that your luck may not last forever.

Then you need to go out and do something for humanity with the incredible resources at your disposal.

Do NOT waste one more day.  You don't know how many you have left.
