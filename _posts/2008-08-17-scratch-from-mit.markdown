MIT made a "development environment" for kids called Scratch.  I finally got around to installing it this afternoon, and collaborated with Lenny on a couple projects:

<a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/lennym/243818">Whale</a>
<a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/lennym/243949">The Feeding Frenzy</a>

They export as Java applets; just press Space to activate them once the page loads.
