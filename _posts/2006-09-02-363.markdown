If, like me, you haven't played Animal Crossing: Wild World in 4 months (the critters all reminded me exactly how long I'd been gone), you may want to pay your town a brief visit.  I found a ton of fish and insects that I'd never seen before.  I also found a ton of weeds, but at least there was a four-leaf clover among them.  I even found a ton of cockroaches in my house!  (Actually, there's no upside to that.)
