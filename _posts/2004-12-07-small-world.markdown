Wow - one of our VPs who I knew pretty well from Omaha just left our company, and I thought I'd never hear from him again.  I just now got a call from him, though, and it turns out he's at one of our business partners.  He was looking to sell new services back to my company.  :)

He's hardly the first - virtually everyone who left Omaha after the layoffs wound up at business partners or competitors, doing work virtually identical to their previous jobs.

I guess your job never changes, only who writes your paycheck.
