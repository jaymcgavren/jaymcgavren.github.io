Got hold of our copy of Animal Crossing for DS (had to go through Amazon to get it)...

Right now our town is basically devoid of all beauty as we shake peaches off the trees and grab every shell that washes ashore so we can sell 'em.  (We have a mortgage to pay, after all.)  There's also no rhyme or reason to the house's decor, 'cause we're using the first hand-me-downs we've gotten.

Bit like getting started in the real world, I guess.  (Except I never resorted to poaching.)
