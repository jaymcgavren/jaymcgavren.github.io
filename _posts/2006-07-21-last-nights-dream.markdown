I was in a game from the makers of Halo (I wasn't playing it, I was IN it), at an arctic base filled with hundreds of people.

My assignment was to disrupt some sort of nuclear energy experiment they were conducting.  I had multiple opportunities to do so, by sabotaging the centrifuges where they were refining uranium, or by waylaying the truck that delivered the finished product to the reactor.  Unfortunately I missed both chances, and they were able to complete the experiment.  The reactor glowed, and the "boss" burst forth from it - a giant, white-furred baboon.  The thing went on a rampage, and I was barely able to avoid it as it careened across the snowy landscape, killing residents of the base left and right.

All this was like a mental preview of how far games have yet to go.  This scene had the narrative and structure of a video game, and yet it WAS real life in all other respects.  Not some low-res, two-dimensional image populated with a couple dozen people and controlled via a joystick, but oh-my-god-dive-outta-the-way-it's-headed-right-for-us reality.

Too bad I won't get to experience this during my lifetime.  Here's the technologies that would have to improve to match what I saw:

-Video.  Not just higher-than-HDTV resolution, but stereoscopic as well.
-Input.  We'd need full-body, real-time motion capture.
-Graphics.  The full polygon output of a single game system today might have been able to render a single character in this world, but there were nearly a hundred of them.
-Processing.  Each of these characters was fully autonomous and capable of responding to spoken requests.  Running all those AIs would bring any modern system to a crawl.
-Physics.  There were a whole lot of ragdolls flying around when that baboon let loose.  But there's promise in this area: I bet the Ageia PhysX card coming out this fall could have done it.
