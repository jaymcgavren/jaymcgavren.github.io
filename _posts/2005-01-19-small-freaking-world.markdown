I'm working on an idea for a media server app, and was trying to think of unique (potentially trademarkable) names for it.  I thought of the server as a kind of glue which lets you access all your content via a single interface.

Hmm... "glue" is a common word - how about a unique spelling like "Gloo"?  I Googled for the word to see if it was already taken:

<a href="http://www.gloolabs.com/gloo.html">Gloo</a>

Aaaghh!  The first hit was for a media sharing app!  How scary is that?
