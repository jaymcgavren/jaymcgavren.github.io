Wedding ceremonies suck.  They don't bore me as much as they used to, though, because it's an interesting window into the bride and groom's relationship.  This is arguably one of the most stressful moments of their entire lives, and you can watch them either silently try to maintain composure, or support each other through it.  (Nate and Kara did the latter.)

Wedding receptions rock.  Especially after the relatives are gone and the people who are there to party take over the floor.

I learned a lot about my friends' significant others this trip, and left with favorable impressions.  I think my friends are going to treat them right, and be treated right in return.

Just received a (heavily Christian) e-card last night saying Chihiro is getting married <em>this week</em>.  We wanted to <em>attend</em>, but at this rate we'll barely be able to get them a gift.  I'm not gonna let this event pass by without recognition, dammit.

Holy crap, my anniversary is coming up.  Gotta figure out what we're gonna do.
