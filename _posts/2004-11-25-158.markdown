Just got informed today that we have until next Friday to get rid of the dog (the $1,000 dog) or be evicted.  Apparently our senile neighbors have been complaining to the housing association about his barking (which we've kept to a more-than-reasonable level), and the landlord got fined.  I thought all he could do for an unauthorized pet was refuse to return our deposit, but evidently that's not the case.

As much as he annoys me, I'm really going to miss Max if we have to give him away.  And I have no doubts about his attachment to us.  I hope he'll be all right...
