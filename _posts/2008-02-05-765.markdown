OMG OMG OMG it's SO much FASTER!!!  This is freaking awesome!

Oh, and I was able to keep the Behavior API backwards-compatible.  I'm pretty proud of that.

I still have to run CollisionConditions every update to ensure things don't pass through each other, though, which sucks because it's the slowest Condition I have.  The GUI may develop telekinetic breeding and eating if I have to change those to ProximityConditions.
