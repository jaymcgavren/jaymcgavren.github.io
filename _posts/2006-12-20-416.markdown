We watched the second episode of The Lost Room last night...  DAMN, this show is cool.  I'm really glad it's a mini-series, too, because it's not going to have time to get lame (ahem, Invasion, maybe but hopefully not Heroes).

Of course, this is TiVoed, so everyone but me probably knows by now whether the ending will kill my buzz.  We'll see, as soon as tonight.
