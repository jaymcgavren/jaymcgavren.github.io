Seeing the Vogons and their triplicate authorization forms in the Hitchhiker's Guide last week has me keenly aware of the bureaucracy within my own company.  Just got this e-mail...

&gt; We have found an opportunity for improvement!  Our Change
&gt; Management process states you should not modify a Change
&gt; Request ("CR") after it has been approved.  There are cases
&gt; where CRs have been modified after they have been approved,
&gt; and the result has been unsuccessful changes.  This is
&gt; problematic for our customers, our employees, and [company name].
&gt;
&gt; Please be aware that if you modify a CR after it is
&gt; approved, you invalidate your CR approval because your
&gt; modifications are not necessarily read.  If you modify a CR
&gt; after it is approved (other than to update the worklog with
&gt; status during/post change), you must reset it for approval.
&gt;  There are no exceptions to this requirement.

"Opportunity for improvement"?  Gag.  This must be the person who suggested that all employees put "<b>Capitalize</b> on our opportunities" as part of their e-mail signatures.  (Which I refuse to do.)

I've resigned myself to the fact that I need to participate in some bare minimum of all this (change request documents, release management documents) to be able to get my job done.  What I have to watch myself for, though, is to ensure that the need to cover my ass doesn't turn me into a bureaucrat myself.
