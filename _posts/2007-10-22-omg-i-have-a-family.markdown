This weekend was great.  No garage sales (that was last weekend), no helping friends move (that's next weekend), no parties (well, there was one but we couldn't get a sitter), no housework (should've been doing some but we let it go).  Just me, my wife, and the boys, vegging out on the couch.  I really feel like we got a chance to reconnect that we hadn't had for a couple months.
