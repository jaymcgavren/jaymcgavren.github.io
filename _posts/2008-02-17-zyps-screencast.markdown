I don't see any way I can convert this to Quicktime MOV for Chris Matthieu's <a href="http://rubyology.com">Rubyology podcast</a> without Quicktime Pro, so I guess I can make my screencast for Zyps public...

Once the new Dell laptop comes in (the Acer's taking a crap), I'm gonna buy QT Pro and try to convert it.  (My desktop is running Win2K right now, which Apple no longer supports.)
