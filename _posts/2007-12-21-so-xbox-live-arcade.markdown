So, Xbox LIVE Arcade is now home to not one, but two really cool marble maze games, one being Switchball which is more methodical and puzzle like, and the second being Marble Blast Ultra which is more race oriented.  Marble Blast isn't particularly appealing graphically, but it's a good showcase for the Torque graphics engine.  Switchball has excellent physics and allows for real creativity in how you solve puzzles.  Both games have a great deal of my attention lately, and are well worth the $5-$10.
