...copy the first sentence of each post you made and post that in a new thread in your LJ.  (Taken from "mr_mooph".)

Here's another interesting unintended use for Google... Just grabbed new albums from Daft Punk, The Chemical Brothers, and The Prodigy, and I have to say I'm really disappointed. I had set up a Technorati blog search for "raskin", to keep me alerted to posts on the exploits of Jef Raskin, user interface guru and my personal idol. SNES game music is back in my playlist. Seeing the Vogons and their triplicate authorization forms in the Hitchhiker's Guide last week has me keenly aware of the bureaucracy within my own company. Someone had left a copy of Soul Calibur II on the shelf in front of me at Target, and I finally decided to stop stalling. My old project manager just reminded me that the new Halo 2 maps are out tonight. There's a travel freeze and a hiring freeze (despite the fact that our department is severely understaffed).
