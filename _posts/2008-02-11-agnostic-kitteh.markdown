<a href="http://www.400monkeys.com/God/">God FAQ</a>

And while finding the link to the above, I also found <a href="http://www.godsfaq.com/">God's FAQ</a>, which for those who insist on believing is a lot more sensible that gets preached in churches:

<blockquote>

A: Of course not. This idea was started by a church who used to sell forgiveness for cash, for Heaven's sake.
