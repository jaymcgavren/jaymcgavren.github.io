Great...  The heartburn is kicking in again.

I'm not really stressed, just a bit depressed.  Wasn't I blogging something along these lines last fall?  I need to go back and read.

<em>Edit:</em>

Okay, I think I'm seeing a pattern here...

I've got that burning, aching melancholy again. It's like the calm before a storm.

It's not even about the baby... I think this happens to me every fall.

<em>2007-08-15</em>:
<blockquote>
My heartburn's starting again. I know it's not triggered by weight, because I just came off a diet. Must be stress, then (and I have no shortage of that).

<em>2006-09-05</em>:
<blockquote>
Ah, that's why I've been in such a blue mood lately! I forgot to listen to The Campfire Headphase for, like, a whole month!
</blockquote>

Clearly, I need to just spend the months of August and September in bed from now on.
