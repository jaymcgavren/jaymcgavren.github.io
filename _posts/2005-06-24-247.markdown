I'm driving home last night, listening to a tech news program.  I'm pretty spaced out after a hard day's work, so basically what I hear from the stereo is this:

blah blah blah blah Jay McGavren blah blah blah blah...

What the?!  I actually swerved a little bit.  Why was my name on the radio?

Well, the tech news program was actually a podcast, SlashDot Review, burned to CD and playing through my MP3 CD player.  And my name was on there because I had donated to them the week before (to help with their considerable bandwidth costs), and I was selected at random for thanks "on the air".

The production value for this show is good enough that one can forget it's not radio.  Just don't let that catch you off guard...
