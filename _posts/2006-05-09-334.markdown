&gt; Nintendo E3 Press Conference Report news from 1UP.com
&gt; "Wii Connect 24 is what the Wii goes into in standby mode,
&gt; allowing the machine to operate key functions and remain
&gt; connected to the Internet, yet it only uses the power of a
&gt; mini-light bulb. The idea is that gamers can leave the
&gt; machine on standby, yet other gamers can even still
&gt; interact with your hardware. In Animal Crossing, someone
&gt; could visit your village while you're asleep!

That addresses a major gripe with the DS Animal Crossing - we had to be logged on for others to visit our town.  We even went so far as to leave the system powered on overnight, but given how crash-prone the connection was, it wasn't at all practical.  I found myself wishing for a PC app that would continue to "serve" our town while the DS was off.  This may be the next-best thing.
