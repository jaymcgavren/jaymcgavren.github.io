I don't like Samurai Shodown V.

They added a bajillion new characters and brought back all the old good ones, but it isn't enough.  I need parries, dodges, combos, counters (or at least much deeper implementations of them than they have here).  The series is really starting to show its age.  And, let's face it, my tastes have changed.

Nonetheless, I do own it now, so those who have their own copies and would like to get a little Live action going, get in touch with me.  Maybe a few bouts with a practiced human opponent will change my mind.
