Hit a couple walls with Zyps...  My fix to make creatures stop turning wildly after resuming an action caused them not to act at all unless they were acting on every object in the environment.  Messy.

So I perused the literature again and found that a couple decent, accessible books on game AI have been written since I last looked.  Added one to my Safari bookshelf, and from skimming it, I appear to be re-inventing the wheel in a couple respects.  No big deal... as far as I know Zyps is still the most easily extendable AI architecture out there, and one of the few suitable for hobbyists.

And the book solved my problem, I think.  Behaviors and Actions will need a little re-architecture, but it appears sweeping changes won't be needed.
