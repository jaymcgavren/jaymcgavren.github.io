I'm astounded - went back to the XP laptop to clean out a worm (the first that's ever gotten past our firewall that I know of), and found myself trying to use OS X keyboard shortcuts.  Years of conditioning to the Microsoft environment, undone in just a couple weeks.

Some old habits do die hard, though - I still find myself holding Caps Lock on the Mac in a futile effort to activate Enso.  I need to visit the Enso mailing list and see how stable it is on OS X.

I'm getting fed up with GUI OSes in general, BTW.  The Mac keyboard shortcuts, while slightly more sensible, are still totally random at times.  I feel like I'm learning Street Fighter special moves or something.  And there's no way in hell I'm using the mouse.

I'm tired of losing the window I want amid the myriad windows onscreen and having no way to find it except command-tilde (or whatever), and the problem is made worse by the multi-monitor setup at work.  I'll sit there hammering on the keyboard, <a href="http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/term_964.txl">wondering why it's not responding</a>, only to realize I've barfed random text all over the terminal on the other monitor.

I'm starting to understand the curmudgeons who refuse to leave Emacs all day, I really am.
