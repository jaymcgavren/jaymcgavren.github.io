He's a George Lucas fan (not just Star Wars, but American Graffiti and others), so I went to Wal-Mart to pick up <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70000760&amp;trkid=73">THX 1138</a>.  (I haven't seen it yet, so I hope it's good.)

The lady at the checkout (who was obviously not American-born), looked at the cover, which features a bald-shaven head with a barcode tag in the ear.  She looked at me and asked, quite seriously, "Is a movie for your head?"

I guess there are more futurists out there than I thought.
