Akismet is doing a good job blocking blog spammers, but now and again I'll get a registration from a .de address or someone named "Nataljia" or so forth.  I'm getting so I automatically delete these users without a second thought.

It must suck to be an Eastern European geek...  You try to post an honest question, and everyone automatically assumes you're a spammer...
