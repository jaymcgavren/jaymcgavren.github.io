I telecommute on Thursday, and since I'll be around to lend Diana a hand, we're gonna try getting the baby up at 10 AM or so, continuing each day through the weekend.  Right now, he's sleeping until noon, which is great, but he's also up until 3 or 4 AM.


Diana sends me to bed earlier and stays up with him, but I'm still lucky if I get 6 hours of sleep a night.  This morning I showed up late for a 10 AM meeting.  Needless to say, this can't continue.
