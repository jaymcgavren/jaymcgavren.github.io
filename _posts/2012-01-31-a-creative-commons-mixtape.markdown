Creative Commons (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">creativecommons.org</a>) is a license you can apply to stuff you create that basically says "anyone can redistribute this as much as they want, they just have to give me credit".  I figured that would enable people to conveniently and legally share huge zip-files of their favorite Creative Commons music, but that hasn't been the case so far.  So, here's my attempt to fix that:

<a href="http://jay.mcgavren.com/files/cc_licensed_music.zip">cc_licensed_music.zip</a>

Just download and unzip; it's already sorted into folders for you.  Drop the whole shebang on top of iTunes to import the tracks.  Share with whoever you like; it's totally legal to do so.

I discovered <a href="/blog/archives/1489">a couple clever tricks with Linux utilities</a> that will let me easily update this file as I discover new CC music, so feel free to bookmark this URL.  And don't worry, I'm being selective; I know there's a lot of crap out there.  These are real gems, though.  If you agree, most of the artists have other music for sale; visit the URLs in each MP3's comment field to find it.
