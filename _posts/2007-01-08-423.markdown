The car's in the shop (probably a bad CV joint from running around with an off-kilter rotor for so long), so I'm telecommuting today...

Anyway, I'm working from the Lappy on the couch while D sleeps in the bedroom.  The dog's sleeping next to me on the couch, and he's "running" in his sleep again.

I've never watched a sleeping dog before, probably because I've never owned a dog that was allowed in the house before, so this is amusing to me.  His four legs twitch independently in an odd rhythm that might or might not actually get him somewhere if he were awake.  He's probably chasing a cat in his dream or something.
