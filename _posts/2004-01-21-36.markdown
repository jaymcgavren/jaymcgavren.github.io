Just woke up from a nap and remembered my dream quite clearly, which is a rarity, so I'll recount it here.

I had several MP3s of Diana's songs - not ones she'd downloaded, ones she'd recorded in a studio.  But I had filed them under the wrong name, so I was moving them to their own folder.

In another part of the same dream, I owned some kind of futuristic jet that was parked in my driveway - it was reddish-orange and could do 30 knots per second (which is really fast, though that's not how they measure the speed of planes).  My youngest brother, John, was showing me how to activate the teleporter so I could leap into the pilot's seat.  (This was an instantaneous teleporter - not like that crappy Star Trek one.)

He was also showing me a Palm Pilot adventure game he'd written.  It had cheesy 2D graphics on the Palm, but when he hooked it up to the XBox, it turned into an amazing VR game with theater-quality sound.

There are even more details than that, but they're a bit hazy.
