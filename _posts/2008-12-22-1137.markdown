So many of our websites and applications and business processes share at least some of the same functionality.  So many of them have redundant implementations that aren't versatile enough to re-use.  If we could <em>somehow</em> reduce that redundancy...  I think the benefits of the reduced maintenance cost would completely offset the drop in performance.
