Just ran into my boss in the hall, and toward the end of the conversation, I realized I had been fidgeting with my wedding ring throughout.  I guess this is better than my previous habit of stroking my (then) new beard, or the habit before that of patting my (then) new beer gut.  Next I suppose Diana will convince me to get a nose job (not really), and I won't be able to stop fiddling with that.
