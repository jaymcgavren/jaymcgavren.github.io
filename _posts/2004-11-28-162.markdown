Lenny's playing Zelda - The Minish cap on an emulator window in the background as I type this...  Not that he knows what he's doing, but he advances through the conversation dialogs like a pro.  :)

Haven't played that far, but the graphics are ultra-slick.  This might be a rival to Link to the Past...
