Was fidgeting with my wedding ring this morning when I felt an odd bump on it; looked down to see a lovely little scratch in the gold.  Had to stop for a minute and think how it could have gotten there...

That's when I realized that wearing it through the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/coconino/recreation/peaks/lava-river-cave.shtml">Lava River Cave</a> was probably not the smartest thing I've ever done.  It's the easiest cave imaginable short of going in and paving a walkway, but I was propping my hand (and therefore the ring) on the walls, floor and ceiling pretty much the whole time.  (The alternative was slipping and cracking my head open.)

Oh, well, I'm sure a jeweler can get the ring back to like-new condition.  I need to think about the fact that I'm wearing it more often, though.

We made it all the way to the end of the cave, by the way, even Lenny.  (I think he had an easier time than I did, in fact.)
