Been playing DJ on the office jukebox with my 5-star songs for the past couple days...  There were many nodyaheads and people signing along to my Audioslave and Ben Folds Five selections yesterday, so I guess I've got okay taste in music.  Don't think today's Fluke songs went over as well, 'cause someone switched it out at some point.  Oh, well.
