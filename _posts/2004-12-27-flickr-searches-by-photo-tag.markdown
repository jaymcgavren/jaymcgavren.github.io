Flickr is a service that lets you upload photos to share with the world.  You can also browse other peoples' albums.
http://www.flickr.com/

Photos can have "tags" associated with them, which are like keywords denoting their subject.  This lets you view everyone's photos by topic:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/

I've found that these tags tend to have the best-quality photos associated with them:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/sunset/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/nature/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/architecture/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/autumn/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/flowers/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/macro/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/reflection/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/trees/

Here's the URL of an RSS feed that combines all these tags (thumbnails will be embedded in the summaries):
