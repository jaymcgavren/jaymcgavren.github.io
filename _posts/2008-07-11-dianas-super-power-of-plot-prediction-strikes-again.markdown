Warning: Partial spoilers of Hancock plot within!

<!--more-->

Went to see Hancock last night, and at the scene where Mary first meets Hancock, Diana predicted what would happen with the character.  I just gave her a bemused look.  I've seen her figure out movie endings before, but this was just a little too far-fetched.

She nailed it.  And I can attest that aside from seeing a preview where Hancock reveals he has amnesia, Diana had <em>no</em> clues from friends, family, or anyone else.  She figured it out "from the way Mary looked at Hancock", which simultaneously suggests to me that Charlize Theron is an <em>incredibly</em> skilled actress, and that my wife's ability to see through a movie plot borders on freakish.
