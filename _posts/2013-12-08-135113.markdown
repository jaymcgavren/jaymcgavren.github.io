In the late 20th century, I received a thorough mocking for only
putting one space after my periods. "*Everyone* puts two spaces after
a sentence, don't you know that?" I switched, and have been using two
spaces for over a decade.

I have a very heavily-ingrained habit to undo:

[Why You Should Never, Ever Use Two Spaces After a Period](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/01/space_invaders.html)

I'm working on a book right now, and the publisher is going to expect
single spaces after each and every sentence. Even if I take corrective
action now, some are still going to slip in, and it's going to be very
time-consuming and error-prone to track them down.

Do your kids a favor, and ensure they're being taught the single-space style.
