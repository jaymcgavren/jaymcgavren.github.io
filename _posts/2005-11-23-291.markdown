Global variables all over the place.  Almost every function has multiple side effects.  Encapsulation is basically nonexistent.

People speak of my predecessor in reverent tones around here, but I'm really not sure why.  Maybe he was especially good at coping with a decidedly crappy language (Informix 4GL).  But from my point of view, this code is a disaster, and I can't help feeling I could do better even in 4GL.

I want very badly to rip everything out and start over.  My boss isn't a big 4GL fan, either, so maybe I'll get my chance.
