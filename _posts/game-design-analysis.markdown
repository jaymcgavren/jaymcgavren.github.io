Hopefully you've seen my [analysis of Subnautica: Below Zero](https://jay.mcgavren.com/2022/09/14/subnautica-below-zero-game-design-analysis.html). There are many other noteworthy puzzles, mechanics, and conventions in games, but most games don't warrant a blog post unto themselves. This post is a catch-all for other patterns I want to record.

If objects need to be interacted with, they are glowing and flashing, or at least heavily lit. They are never static in appearance.

Power attacks do heavy damage, but have a windup and/or a recovery time, during which you are vulnerable.

Heavy objects can only be dragged along level, smooth surfaces, thus constraining them to a particular area (and keeping the player from wasting time and ruining other puzzles by dragging a box everywhere they go).

Enemies and breakable objects can serve as markers of where you _haven't_ been. If an area is littered with broken crates and devoid of enemies, it's an implicit sign that you've already explored there.

Weird West: You can carry raw meat on you, but it can only be prepared at a campfire, and must be consumed immediately. This restricts food consumption to the campfire, while still requiring that inventory space be spent to carry the meat.

Weird West: When enemies switch to alerted status, a HUD message explains the reason e.g.: "A body you left behind was spotted". Avoids confusion over why they were alerted.

# Co-op Multiplayer

Deep Rock Galactic: Some enemy types (glyphid grunt guards, praetorians) have extra armor in the front, making them resistant to the player they are approaching. But they are weaker on the sides or rear, meaning a flanking player will do extra damage to them.
