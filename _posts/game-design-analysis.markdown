Hopefully you've seen my [analysis of Subnautica: Below Zero](https://jay.mcgavren.com/2022/09/14/subnautica-below-zero-game-design-analysis.html). There are many other noteworthy puzzles, mechanics, and conventions in games, but most games don't warrant a blog post unto themselves. This post is a catch-all for other patterns I want to record.

Heavy objects can only be dragged along level, smooth surfaces, thus constraining them to a particular area (and keeping the player from wasting time and ruining other puzzles by dragging a box everywhere they go).

Enemies and breakable objects can serve as markers of where you _haven't_ been. If an area is littered with broken crates and devoid of enemies, it's an implicit sign that you've already explored there.
