Hopefully you've seen my [analysis of Subnautica: Below Zero](https://jay.mcgavren.com/2022/09/14/subnautica-below-zero-game-design-analysis.html). There are many other noteworthy puzzles, mechanics, and conventions in games, but most games don't warrant a blog post unto themselves. This post is a catch-all for other patterns I want to record.

Heavy objects can only be dragged along level, smooth surfaces, thus constraining them to a particular area (and keeping the player from wasting time and ruining other puzzles by dragging a box everywhere they go).

Enemies and breakable objects can serve as markers of where you _haven't_ been. If an area is littered with broken crates and devoid of enemies, it's an implicit sign that you've already explored there.

Weird West: You can carry raw meat on you, but it can only be prepared at a campfire, and must be consumed immediately. This restricts food consumption to the campfire, while still requiring that inventory space be spent to carry the meat.

Weird West: When enemies switch to alerted status, a HUD message explains the reason e.g.: "A body you left behind was spotted". Avoids confusion over why they were alerted.
