I've already plowed through the source for 3 different programs, trying to follow the flow of data for a single process.  I'm not even sure where the trail ends.  All of these things are dependent on each other, and before I run any of them, I have to be sure there won't be any adverse side effects.  Is this what I face for the next year?!
