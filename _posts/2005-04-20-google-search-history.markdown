Yeehaw!  This will be a treasure trove for personal data mining: <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/20/2128216&amp;from=rss">Google has added a search history</a>.  When you use Google as often as I do (several times daily), this could generate a very rich map of the topics you're thinking about.  And since Google saves everything to your account and maps it to a calendar, you can actually go back in time and see what you were working on for any given date.

Privacy advocates needn't fret (much); it's opt-in, and you can "pause" the search logging at any time.

This is a very cool feature that I didn't know I needed until now.  :)
