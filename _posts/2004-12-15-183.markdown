Looks like Viz has just released both the anime and manga for Here is Greenwood.  Finally, I can get rid of the last of my VHS tapes!  (Hmm, wonder what they'd brin on eBay?)  I also no longer need to feel guilty for just letting the fan translation drop for the manga.

Of course, I should probably save my purchasing/auctioning/rejoicing until I see how badly they've screwed up the translations...
