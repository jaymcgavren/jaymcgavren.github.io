...my best time yet.  Not bad for rush hour.

Remember the original Ridge Racer for the Playstation?  My commute kind of reminds me of that.  Not because of the high speeds or the thumping techno soundtrack, but because of the beautiful, curving mountain roads and the tendency for airplanes to occasionally shoot overhead (I pass near two airfields).

It's a good thing the drive is so cool, because I'll be spending nearly an hour and a half on the road each day.  :/
