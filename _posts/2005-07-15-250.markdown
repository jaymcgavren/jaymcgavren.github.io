I'm downloading some database software, and the license contains this little passage...

&gt; Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on
&gt; [vendor]'s part or other liability, You are entitled to recover
&gt; damages from [vendor]. In each such instance, regardless of the
&gt; basis on which You may be entitled to claim damages from
&gt; [vendor], (including fundamental breach, negligence,
&gt; misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), [vendor] is
&gt; liable for no more than 1) damages for bodily injury
&gt; (including death) and damage to real property and tangible
&gt; personal property...

Ah, good.  If the database kills anybody or destroys their house, at least I'll be covered.
