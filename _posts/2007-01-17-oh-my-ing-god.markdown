One copy of Burning Crusade will upgrade ONE WoW account.  Another $40 to upgrade the second, which I wouldn't even have if it wasn't required to play from 2 PCs at once.  Not only that, there's no way to purchase a key online (that I could find).  I had to run to the store after another freaking box, just to get the %$#@ 26-digit code inside.

Fuck you, Blizzard.  Fuck you.
