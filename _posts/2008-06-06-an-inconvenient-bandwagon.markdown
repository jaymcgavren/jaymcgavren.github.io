One of the directories we publish our offerings to has a CarbonImpact field in their web service API.  (No, we don't track that in our database.)

Look, I'm all in favor of greening up various industries; it's needed to happen for quite some time.  But stupid stuff like this is going to reduce the environmental movement to a fad, when it needs to be a sustained effort.  Energy efficiency ratings need to be printed on labels for physical goods, not services.
