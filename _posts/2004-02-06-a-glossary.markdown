A recent conversation turned to weird acronyms we use only at work or school, and I realized I had an insanely large number...

ACU: Automated Channel Update
AGU: Automatic GDS Update
AMF: ASCII Message Format
BRD: Business Requirements Document
CRS: Central Reservation System
DTE: Data Transfer Express
FDD: Functional Design Document
GDS: Global Distribution System
HOD: Hotel Operational Description
PFF: Positional Flat File
PRINUP: PRoperty INformation UPdate
SMP: Screen Management Program
SOP: Standard Operating Procedure
SWAD: System Works As Designed
SWAG: Scientific Wild-Ass Guess
TDD: Technical Design Document
TPE: Transaction Processing Environment

...and that's just what I could think of off the top of my head.  :P

I recently titled a document "Sabre HOD PFF FDD".  I kid you not.

Anyone else have any they'd like to share?
