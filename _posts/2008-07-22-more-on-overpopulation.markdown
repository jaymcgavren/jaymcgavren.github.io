Excuse me while I indulge in unbridled futurism (bordering on science-fiction)...

Population growth is already levelling off in societies where children are more of a liability than an asset.  (They can't help you till the fields anymore, after all.)  Once the overpopulation problem peaks, I could imagine it becoming the norm for teens to seek permanent contraception (reversible or not).

So then the question becomes: what sort of person would make the choice to become a "breeder"?  And how will that affect the gene pool?  There are already theories flying about that there may be genes that cause a predisposition toward conservatism; what if there's a gene that causes an especially strong desire to procreate?  If contraception is the norm, those without such urges would quickly (willingly?) die out.
