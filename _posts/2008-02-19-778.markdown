I think I'm gonna go cold turkey on coffee.  It may help keep me awake, but drinking 3 cups a day probably isn't doing much for my productivity (anymore), and certainly isn't good for my stomach lining.

We'll see how much I regret that decision later.  Even now I can hear the coffee maker here at work, and am having to resist the urge to grab my mug and head over there.
