Been playing Secret of Mana with Lenny - he asks to every night.  (Except last night, when he asked to play Return Fire.  The kid's got good taste.)

It's a shame we have to go that far back in the gaming museum to find a good multiplayer adventure.  When I am king, every game will feature a multiplayer component.  (And while I'm not into censorship, options to turn off blood and gore would be nice.)
