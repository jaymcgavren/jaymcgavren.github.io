Is it just me, or are Cucumber tests in combination with Webrat <em>really</em> brittle?  I'm generating messages to go in my inbox, and they weren't showing up because I forgot to make them "from" the current user.  I can't say:

<pre>
Given I am on the messages page #BAD
And there are 4 messages #BAD
</pre>

...because that would load a page with no messages on it.  It has to be:

<pre>
Given there are 4 messages
And I am on the messages page
</pre>

Not as versatile as Cucumber advocates seem to be promising.  Maybe I'll get used to this kind of stuff over time, but right now I'm encountering/generating way too many head-scratching bugs to be productive.
