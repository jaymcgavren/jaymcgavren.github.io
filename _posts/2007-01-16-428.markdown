This article suggests that a minimum wage hike is essential not just to everyone's livelihood, but their safety as well...

&gt; If the gap between rich and poor gets too large, and if
&gt; those at the bottom feel they have no meaningful route to
&gt; the riches at the top, then the fabric of society will
&gt; fray, or even come unraveled entirely.
...
&gt; Shortly before I arrived in Brazil, a British tour bus was
&gt; hijacked and robbed in broad daylight on the way from Rio's
&gt; international airport to a ritzy beach area. While I was
&gt; there, two Supreme Court justices were carjacked on the
&gt; same road.
&gt; Overall, the murder rate in Brazil is five times that of
&gt; New York City.
...
&gt; The New York Times reported recently on a World Bank study
&gt; concluding that if Brazil had the much lower homicide rate
&gt; of Costa Rica, Brazil's GDP would have been three to eight
&gt; percent higher in the 1990s.
&gt; As one economist explained in the article, "You have money
&gt; spent on guarding stuff rather than making stuff." And when
&gt; international investors look around the globe, they choose
&gt; safer places.
