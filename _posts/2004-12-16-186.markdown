Here's a sampling of the terminology used in Chapter 1 of Strunk and White's <u>The Elements of Style</u>:

appositive
posessive singular
pronominal posessive
indefinite pronoun
parenthetic expression
nonrestrictive relative clause
restrictive term of identification

The chapter's titled "Elementary Rules of Usage".  No wonder people are daunted by language studies...
