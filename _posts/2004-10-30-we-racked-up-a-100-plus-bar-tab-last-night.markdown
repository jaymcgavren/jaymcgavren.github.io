But that was me, Diana, and two other people...  Diana's friend and her boyfriend racked up a similar tab all by themselves, and most of that went to the boyfriend.  I had to stand guard to ensure nothing turned violent while Diana's mom stood outside trying to talk him out driving off in a drunken, sobbing stupor over a domestic spat.  I was freezing my ass off the whole time.  Fun.

Had a dream this morning that I was attending school, studying network hacking and Japanese culture, with the goal of becoming a surgeon.  Odd part was (as if there weren't enough odd parts already), I was going to be a surgeon with my new department at my current employer.  At one point all my co-workers were dressed in scrubs, ready to go witness a surgery.  (These people are programmers in real life.)
