Just spent half the afternoon trying to update a field via this legacy app I maintain, only to find that it reads the value from an update file and then silently discards it.  (And that's what it's "supposed" to do.)

And then while trying to explain my own dumbassery, my co-worker realizes that the field she told me needed fixing wasn't even the right one.  Arrrggghh!
