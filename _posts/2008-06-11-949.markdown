I asked Diana a couple nights ago if content access permissions for the media server (and by extension, as a general rule) should default to open or closed.  Her answer was a resounding "closed".  I suspect most people, when the problem is explained to them, will answer the same.  Hell, I think I might do so myself.

But unlike most people, I can envision the incredible possibilities for data mining projects (both selfish and altruistic) that would be possible with a system that defaults to open...  In fact, I have to question whether it's even worth the effort to make the interfaces to all this content uniform if the stuff that should be publicly accessible isn't...
