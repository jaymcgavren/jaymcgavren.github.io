I really can't pronounce it a huge success; I had a group of about ten people.  Not insanely pleased with how everything went, but that may be just my own overly self critical eye on it.

Part of the problem was that I was flustered - I couldn't get the projector working despite arriving 15 minutes early...  10 minutes in, Lorin Thwaits finally got it going with the help of some UAT staff.  (Many thanks to him for rescuing the presentation!)

Got a couple questions, got modest replies, I think it was just too early in the morning for me and for everyone else.
