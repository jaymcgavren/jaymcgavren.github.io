Zyps has a (hopefully) regular contributor!  He just submitted an ExplodeAction <em>with unit tests</em>.  (I didn't even have to ask for 'em.)  And the Environment#&lt;&lt; method he came up with is so convenient (it takes any argument, then calls the appropriate accessor) that I could slap my forehead for not having thought of it myself.

Next he&#039;s gonna tackle either a new generic View, or a domain-specific language for Environment setup, wherever his interest takes him.  This guy knows what he&#039;s doing, so I&#039;ll just let him at it.

<b>Edit:</b> Ergh, but he uses double-space characters instead of tabs for indentation.  I take all that praise back.  :)
