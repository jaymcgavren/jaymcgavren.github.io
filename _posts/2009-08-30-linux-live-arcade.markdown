You know, it wouldn't be that hard to re-do the MythTV frontend system to be like XBox Live/Wii channels.  Instead of shows, you'd flip through games available for download.  When you found one you wanted, you could choose a menu entry to install it via the package manager.

Networking would be a little harder - you'd need a list of IP addresses for your friends/party members, which would then need to be fed to the command line for each game using that game's options.  I don't think exiting back to the menu in the event of a connection failure could be made automatic in most cases, either, but that may not be a show-stopper.

I'm on this train of thought because I'm a little tired of dumping money into these locked-down ecosystems that I know will go away as soon as my console dies.  I know I can't attract people to play open-source games when the consoles are so much better integrated, so anything that ties a few titles together can surely help.  There were some efforts in this regard a few years back, but I haven't heard anything of them since...
