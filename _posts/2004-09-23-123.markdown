Out of boredom, I Googled for my own name today.  I wanted to see what dark corners of the Net my reputation had spread to.  (I was surprised at just how far it had gone.)

Anyway, here's an amusing post from a Neo-Geo mailing list in response to a post from doshichan:

<pre>
&gt;&gt;I still think the best game mag to come out in recent times was Game On!
&gt;&gt;USA, which some of our MLers, namely Shidoshi and Greg Kasavin, were a
&gt;&gt;part of.
&gt;
&gt;Greg was part of the staff? Wow, guess I either noticed and just don't
&gt;remember, or it never occoured to me.

I double-checked...it's definitely him! This is for Vol. 1, number 7,
BTW.

&gt;
&gt;Little bit of trivia: I wrote for more issues than many people think. After
&gt;being hired over at GameFan, I switched over to using the name J.J. Dagger
&gt;to avoid GF possibly finding out that I was writing for two magazines.

Really? I need to go back and see if I still have any old issues that
you might be in!

&gt;As
&gt;well, contributor Jay McGavren, who mostly helped out in the codes section,
&gt;was one of the guys I used to make my old fanzine with.

Really? Cool! I remember him back when he was on AOL using the name
"TheSpook1". He was MAJORLY into the Game Genie, and started a club.
Those were the good ol' days...
