Did anyone ever actually *try* to build an app with JAX-RPC before it was unleashed on an unsuspecting world?  You wouldn't believe the contortions I have to go through to do a simple thing like altering SOAP headers.

I desperately want to switch to the newer JAX-WS, but that framework no longer allows the message format that our vendor wants.  (Yeah, there's a good sign.)
