My boss just called me into his office to meet someone - I guess his interviewee is currently working at my old company, and has worked with a bunch of my old Perl libraries.  He had been looking forward to meeting me, because a lot of his Perl knowledge had been gleaned from working with my code.

I'm probably one of the Valley's foremost remaining experts on Perl 5.  Not that this is something to be particularly proud of; it's basically a dead language.  Still, it's nice to know your code is being studied and used.
