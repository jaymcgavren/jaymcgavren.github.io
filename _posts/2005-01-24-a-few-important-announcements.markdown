The hot and sour soup at Flo's Chinese is very, very good.

The dog came in from the back yard limping for no apparent reason.  I of course promptly freaked out, thinking he might have a broken leg, and I was horrified the Diana and her mom were telling me to wait and see if it got better.  They finally agreed to my taking him to the vet, though.

Three x-rays, 150 dollars, and two hours later, and they didn't find anything.  They sent him home with an anti-inflammatory and said to restrict his exercise.  (I.e. no barelling around the house at 90 miles an hour.)

The next day he's prancing around as if nothing ever happened.  <i>That</i> was a waste of money.  Guess the ladies were right.

Lenny is to the point where he demands one of everything in the grocery if you take him.  I now hate - absolutely <i>hate</i> - any snack food company that makes a promotional deal with children's television shows (Barney-shaped fruit snacks and so on).
