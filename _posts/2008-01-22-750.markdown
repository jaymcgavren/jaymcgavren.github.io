Thought I was ready to graduate from Easy mode on Rock Band drums...  and I am, on "Creep" and "Say It Ain't So".  Anything else utterly kicks my ass.

It's really tough for Diana and me to line up time to play together.  Last night was the first time in a week, and will likely be the last until the weekend.
