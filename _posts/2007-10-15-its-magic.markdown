I wanted to look at my logs directory today, and before I knew it, the window was in front of me.  After considering for a moment, I realized I had typed "open logs" (a shortcut I'd set up) into Enso <em>without thinking</em>.

This is the point I have been seeking to get to with computer interfaces, any computer interface, for years now.  Humanized had to do a horrible, terrifying Windows hack to make it work, but they made it work.

Now, where are my LEAP keys?
