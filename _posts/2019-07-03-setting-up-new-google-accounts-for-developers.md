I don't like many of the default settings in GMail and other Google accounts. And sadly, there is no settings import, so new accounts have to be set up manually. I just switched employers, so I find myself having to set up a new account from scratch. I'm recording my settings changes here in the hopes it will help others out.

* If you're switching employers, you may have an old account that you want to remove from the Google account list. Follow the directions [here](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/123604/how-to-remove-accounts-from-choose-an-account-list-in-google-sign-in) to do so. (Yes, you have to sign out from your current account in order to display the option to remove other accounts.)
* Agree to your company's policies, and Google's as well. Be aware that unlike a regular Google account, the account administrator may be able to inspect any and all data (emails, etc.) stored in your account.
* Choose your preferred Gmail display layout. I recommend "Compact" but that's personal preference.
* Fix your settings. Click the gear icon and choose "Settings".
    * Under the "General" tab:
        * Set "Maximum Page Size" to 100.
        * Set "Undo Send" cancellation period to at least 10 seconds.
        * Set "Default reply behavior" to "Reply all". (Yes, you should minimize unnecessary CCs on email when possible. But I find that the best _default_ is "Reply all".)
        * Smart compose: Like tab completion for email. I actually don't mind this feature but some may want to consider turning it off.
        * Desktop notifications: I personally like to keep notifications on - if I want to concentrate then I just close my Gmail tab.
        * __Keyboard shortcuts__: Emphasizing this because it's the most important setting here. Turn them on and learn to use them!
        * My picture: Strongly consider uploading one. If you don't have a good photo available right now, email yourself a reminder to get one. No, self-consciousness is not an excuse for skipping this, not on a work account.
        * Create contacts for auto-complete: Set to "I'll add contacts myself" so your contact list doesn't grow unmanageable.
        * Vacation responder: No need to set this now, but make note that it's here; you'll need it at some point!
        * Click "Save changes" at the bottom when done.
    * Choose "Settings" again and choose the "Themes" tab:
        * Set a theme that's visually distinct from any other GMail accounts you have.
* Be sure to add your new account on your phone as well!

Hope this helps you out! Have a story of a "gotcha" with GMail settings? Reply in the comments; I might even update this post to help others avoid the same pitfalls!
