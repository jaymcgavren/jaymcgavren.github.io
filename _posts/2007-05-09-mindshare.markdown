What's been occupying me lately:

Ruby.  Like, consuming my every waking moment.  It's as exciting as Perl was back in 1999, but unlike Perl, I already have an app deployed that an ordinary Windows user could install, with more to come.

Google Code.  Sourceforge was pioneering, but this makes development something I want to do every day.

A Web service client I'm writing for work.  It's in Java, and the vendor's forcing me to use janky protocols with janky libraries.  I've been able to isolate the damage to two classes so far, but who can say what's next?

God of War II.  It's not as polished as the first, but it's still pretty damn good.

Disgaea 2.  If you've never played a tactical RPG before, you'll probably raise an eyebrow at this one, but I don't care.  It's got depth and technique and it's cute.  You can even skip the storyline if you can't stand it.

Dreamhost.  Thanks to a discount code I scored 300GB of storage for $10 a month.  (Twice the size of my hard drive at home.)  I mainly want the shell, Web server, Subversion, and Rails.  Shutting down my personal Apache at home without having to give up access to any of my files is a nice bonus, though.

Oh yeah, and the baby.  Though mostly he just prevents me from concentrating on any of the above.
