After an initial glitch with the installation (which we've fixed), our testing department has reported only one defect with my new application, and that was just a so-called security risk (an offer to remember passwords) generated by Internet Explorer.  117 tests down, 50 or so to go.

Either testing isn't doing their job (which is possible), or we did our job pretty darn well.
