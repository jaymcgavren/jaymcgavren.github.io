Audioscrobbler/last.fm finally calculated my "musical neighbors" (people with similar taste to me, as judged by the tracks they play), and now <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/nephariuz/">my profile</a> radio is running.  It's pretty good at guessing songs I'd like, even though I'd never seek them out on my own.  (Of course, it also plays a lot of tracks I already have, but for someone without a large music collection, it'd be a godsend.)

There are other systems similar to Audioscrobbler's for news and movies, but none seem very polished yet.  But the day is fast approaching when everything - Flickr pictures, Web links, TV shows - is retrieved for you automatically based on what you've downloaded in the past.  You'll just flip on your set-top box, and something you (probably) want to see/hear will be there waiting for you.

Of course, spam could easily prove a problem.  Audioscrobbler already had to set up throttling to stop people from artificially inflating the rank of their favorite artist.  One could imagine a spammer building a profile identical to yours (hey, look how similar our tastes are! you should listen to some of my music!), then inserting a link to their own Viagra ad.  We'll need trust networks to go along with these recommendation networks...
