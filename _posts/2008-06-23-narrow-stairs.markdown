D and I are both definitely liking Narrow Stairs (Death Cab for Cutie).  "Cath..." is a whole season of a TV drama wrapped up in a single song.  "Bixby Canyon Bridge" evokes the lyrical part of "Different Names for the Same Thing", "I Will Posess Your Heart" the rambling jam session part.  There's a few songs that are mediocre by the band's standards but that means you merely listen to them instead of include them on "soundtrack of my life" mixtapes.

Plans remains the album to get first, but if you're hungry for more after that, Narrow Stairs may satiate you.
