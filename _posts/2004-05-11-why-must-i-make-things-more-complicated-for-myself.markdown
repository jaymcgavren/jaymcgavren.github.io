So our contact with this company that maintains one of our external sites called, asking for a password that he probably already has on a post-it somewhere.  I know said password and use it every month, but in the spirit of covering my ass, instead of just giving it to him, I contact our sysadmin (who's in charge of logins) to either grant him access or tell him to %&amp;@# himself.

I just checked the remedy ticket, and they're prepping to reset the password and send the new one only to this guy.  *I'm* going to lose access unless I scramble to intervene.

Why do I even try to do things the right way?
