Jack Johnson - Symbol in My Driveway

Got you a brand new weapon, let's see
How destructive we can be
Got a brand new set of stencils
I been connecting all the dots
Got my plans in a Ziploc bag, let's see
How unproductive we can be

There's more, and it all fits me perfectly.  Eric, if you do another MoMa OST, this is my pick.
