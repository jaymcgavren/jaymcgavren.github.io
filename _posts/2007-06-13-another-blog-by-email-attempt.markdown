I really want this blog-by-mail feature working, but multiple others have the same problem and it still hasn't been address.  So I'm implementing the suggestion here:http://wordpress.org/support/topic/83483....And hopefully this post will have a body.<strong>Edit: </strong><em>Yay, it works!  (Except for that annoying period at the end.  I'll have to look for a real fix.)</em>
