I'm in Omaha!  Yay.  I'm posting this from Glen's PC at his new house (which he shares with three roommates).

Definitely a high geek quotient here - there are Dilbert stickers and calendars all over the place, co-ax and cat-5 cable strung everywhere, a video game system occupying every available shelf, and boxes of anime in the basement.  None of this, as far as I can tell, is Glen's doing...
