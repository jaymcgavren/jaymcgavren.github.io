Heh...  My old <a href="http://jay.mcgavren.com/ragegames/">Rage Games</a> site just got (properly?) credited on <a href="http://rocketboom.com">Rocketboom</a>'s <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/rb_08_aug_15/">August 15th episode</a> as the original poster of an "All Your Base" animated GIF.  I have no idea if the Something Awful people (who eventually popularized the meme) got it from me, from Zany Video Game Quotes, or just on their own, but it's always nice to just be sitting there flipping through Tivo programs and hear your work mentioned.
