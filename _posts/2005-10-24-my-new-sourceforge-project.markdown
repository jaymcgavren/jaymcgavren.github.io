&gt; Zyps are small creatures with minds of their own. You can
&gt; create dozens of Zyps, then decide how each will act. (Will
&gt; it run away from the others? Follow them? Eat them for
&gt; lunch?) You can combine rules and actions to create very
&gt; complex behaviors.

I've never delved this deep into vector math before, but it's going pretty well so far.  I've already got about a hundred of the little critters following each other around simultaneously.  (And already they surprise me with unexpected behaviors.  When I'm done it's gonna be like they're really alive.)
