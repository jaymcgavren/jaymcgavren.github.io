I really didn't understand why blog-to-book would be so hard...  Blurb's Booksmart blog slurper was cumbersome at best and incompetent at worst, and the only other competitor in the field closed up shop a couple years ago.

Well, Qoop has rolled out <a href="http://www.blogprinting.com">BlogPrinting.com</a>, and so far it Just Works.  I know their site looks like it was made to harvest passwords, but enter your info and you'll be treated to a nicely-formatted PDF preview of your blog in book form, complete with embedded images, in about 3 minutes.  My &lt;pre&gt; tags (meaning all my code snippets) all got wrapped into a messy blob, but most folks don't use those.  Posts marked private <em>are</em> included (a good thing for me), but you could probably filter them by setting up a special login for the site to use.

Price is quite reasonable, too: $22 for a 379-page 6x9 book in black and white.  (For gods' sake, don't leave it on color (the default), it was $120 for the same book.)  I'll follow up when I actually get the book, but so far this is <em>really</em> nice.

WordPress, Movable Type, and TypePad are all supported for now.  Not sure if my LiveJournal friends can use the Movable Type option, but if not, drop me a line and I'll walk you through exporting to WordPress.
