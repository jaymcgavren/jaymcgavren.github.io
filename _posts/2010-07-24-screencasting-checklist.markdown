I've recorded one too many screencasts in an unreadably small font.  I thought I'd made a pre-recording checklist, but I seem to have lost it.  So here we go again, and this time I'll share it with the Web at large:

<pre>
Ensure iShowU is on "Rails Demo" preset:
  Record microphone, system audio off
  Normal frame rate: 5
  Compression: Apple Animation
  Capture Size: 800 x 600
  Show capture guide whether recording or not
  Follow mouse cursor: false
  Edit recording area so it's in upper left, touching underside of system menu
Set iShowU keyboard shortcuts:
  Start capture: Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-3
  Pause capture: Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-4
Size windows to fit within capture area:
  Web browser
  Shell(80 columns x 30 rows)
  Editor
Increase font size to 20-point or larger:
  Web browser ("Zoom In" x 2)
  Shell
  Editor
Plain background as desktop
Close all possible apps
</pre>
