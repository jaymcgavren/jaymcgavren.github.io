I'm doing <a href="http://www.desertcodecamp.com/signUp.aspx?session=389">a talk on Zyps</a> at <a href="http://www.desertcodecamp.com/">Desert Code Camp</a> on Saturday, May 31st.  (Exact time TBD.)  There are <a href="http://www.desertcodecamp.com/sessions.aspx#Track250">several other Ruby sessions</a> as well, ranging from beginner to expert.

If you're in the Phoenix/Tempe area, go get signed up!
