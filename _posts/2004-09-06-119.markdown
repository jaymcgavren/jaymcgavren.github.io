Diana, Lenny and I are watching her folks's house over the weekend...  We meant to bring a Dreamcast for entertainment but forgot it, so when we were at the mall I picked up one of those Jakks Pacific plug and play controllers with games embedded in it.  (We chose the one with 5 Namco arcade games over the Atari 2600 paddle with 17 games in it.)  Not too bad for 20 bucks, though I'm a little disappointed that it runs off batteries (4 AAAs) and has no 2-player options.

Len and Connie (Diana's dad and stepmom) have 3 dogs who are for the most part quite lovable.  The dachsund is a royal pain in the ass, however.  Right now she's running all over the house barking, and it's a matter of time before she wakes up Lenny (who has been sleeping for much of the day thanks to his cough).  I want to punt that dog into next Tuesday...
