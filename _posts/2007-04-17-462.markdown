Released my first Ruby app last night...

http://code.google.com/p/itunes-control/

...it's just a simple command line controller for Windows iTunes, but the groundwork is laid for much cooler stuff.  After jumping through some hoops I was able to make it a standalone app (no Ruby installation required), in addition to an ordinary Ruby gem.  Future releases will likely have installers for Mac, Linux, and Windows alike, with no additional switch-flipping on my part.
