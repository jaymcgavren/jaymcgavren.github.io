<a href="http://jay.mcgavren.com/blog/archives/638/051-gui/" rel="attachment wp-att-639" title="0.5.1 GUI"><img src="http://jay.mcgavren.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/zyps_051.thumbnail.PNG" alt="0.5.1 GUI" align="left" hspace="10" /></a> The zyps GUI is actually tolerable now - the main addition was a simple speed limiter EnvironmentalFactor.  The Push and Pull actions are pretty cool, too.  I also ripped out user-defined conditions, as they just made things complicated and didn't offer much useful functionality.

The GUI actually isn't my top priority, but it will be most people's introduction to the library, so it's important to put my best foot forward.

Now to get a reliable, safe dRb server (is that an oxymoron?) going before the next Ruby users group meeting.  The programming challenge at Desert Code Camp showed me a shared environment for programmers to play around in, however unstable, can be a great deal of fun.
