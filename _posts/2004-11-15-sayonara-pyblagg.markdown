How is it I failed to notice that Mozilla Thunderbird can read RSS feeds and handle them almost identically to e-mail?

Items in each feed are stored in a separate folder, and like e-mail, the number of new items in each folder are displayed after they're retrieved.  You can delete posts once you read them, and they'll be stored in a trash bin.  You can also forward them just as easily as a regular e-mail.  (You all thought I was spamming you with random articles before?  You ain't seen nothin' yet! :)
