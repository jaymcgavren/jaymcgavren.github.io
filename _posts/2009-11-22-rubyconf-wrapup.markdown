RubyConf was awesome, and I'd like to think we made our contribution.  The <a href="http://jemini.org">Jemini</a> talk generated a lot of interested questions, and I'm pretty happy with the approach of using a screencast instead of slides (though we'll see how it turns out in the Confreaks video).  Last night Logan and I set up in the lobby with Life-Tank and our collection of XBox controllers, which attracted quite a few players and comments of "I gotta try this library when I get home".

Enjoyed the Bay Area Computer Music Technology meetup at Pier 38, too.  Got to promote <a href="http://github.com/jaymcgavren/rubyonacid">Ruby On Acid</a>, too.  I showed off the usual graphical stuff, then the 8-bit PCM/WAV ("drunk Atari 2600") sound and MIDI demos that I hacked together for the meetup.  The audio demos need some experimentation before they're ready for prime time, but I'd say the same of most things shown that evening.  The other presenters clearly had more music composition education and/or experience, but I got a surprisingly warm reception anyway.

Had a lot of fun in SF.  Great conference, great city, great people.  If the right company is hiring I will definitely consider moving here.
