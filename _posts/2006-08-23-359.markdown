Orbitz "customer care" has been e-mailing us every two weeks to notify us of changes to our flight itinerary to Omaha.  Not a change in carriers or flight numbers, but arrival and departure times.

The average change is about 3 minutes.  I have to carefully compare the new to the old each time to verify it, though.  :P  If buying this early weren't saving us hundreds of dollars, I might be annoyed.
