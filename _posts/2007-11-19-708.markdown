Dreamt last night that I was testing a new jet for the Air Force.  It was made of plastic, completely recyclable, and intended to be disposable.

It worked off of voice commands or thought, and ran a preprogrammed mission schedule - in fact I'm not really sure why it needed a human pilot, unless something went wrong.  But there I was in the pilot's seat, and I put the jet through its paces according to instructions from the ground.

Then my alarm went off.  Hit snooze.  The jet was gone, and replaced with the power to fly unaided.  Alarm went off again.  Hit snooze.  Now I could fly <em>and</em> perform Christ-like healing miracles.  Yeah.  Then Diana burst into the room, saying we were going to be late for our appointment.  Dream over, man.
