I finally have my Perl module talking with the Apollo system!  (I've been trying to do that for over a year, but other projects keep coming up.)  It was always an embarrassment having to say that I support "all the GDSs.  Well, except for Apollo."

Kinda dumb that I couldn't get to it until it looked like I'd be leaving my department.  Oh, well, at least it's done.

P.S.: While I was writing this, my test script freaked out and crashed.  :P  Hopefully it's nothing major.
