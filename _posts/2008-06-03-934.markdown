I've heard from a couple places now that smaller doses of caffeine throughout the day are better than a single jolt in the morning.  So I'm trying to switch to green tea, which is supposed to have less...

But it seems like four times the kick, and not in a good way.  I feel like my heart is going to pump its way right out of my ribcage.  And it's definitely due to the tea - this is the second occasion it's happened.

Diana had similar effects several years ago.  What the heck is in this stuff?
