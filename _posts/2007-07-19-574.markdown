Between the baby, work, upcoming surgeries, and everything else, it'll sometimes take me a whole week to get back to the problems I want to work on.  Not only can I not solve them, I can't even work on them.  I spend the entire interim with them at the back of my mind.

I've always been about instant gratification.  This is really frustrating.
