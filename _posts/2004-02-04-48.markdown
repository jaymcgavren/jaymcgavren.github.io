Wrote a couple quick scripts to let me store the names and command lines of all my Windows shortcuts in a plain text file, then (re)generate the shortcut files on the fly.  It let me convert all my Web shortcuts from opening in Internet Explorer to opening in Mozilla/Firebird with one quick search and replace.  Not bad.

Now, what else do I need to move to a centralized text file?
