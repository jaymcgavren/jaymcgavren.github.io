The power button on my PC refused to work last night.  Fiddling with the connections got it going, but then it turned off in mid-boot.

Finally got it running, but I shut it down for the day while I'm at work, lest it catch fire or something.  Diana keeps telling me to quit messing with this home-built crap and get a Dell or some such.  Maybe she's right.
