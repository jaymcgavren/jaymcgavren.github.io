A change to our vendor's WSDL has me back to dinking around with wscompile and wsimport again.  I think they've screwed up somewhere in their chain of a dozen XSD imports, 'cause I'm getting "already defined" errors.  I don't dare refer to any book published before 2006 for help, because it will be flat-out wrong.  Argh - so, so frustrating.
