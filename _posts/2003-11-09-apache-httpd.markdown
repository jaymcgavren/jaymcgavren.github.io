I've wanted to be able to access my files from anywhere for some time now, but any solution I could come up with was just too cumbersome.  Well, I finally got over my fears and installed Apache Webserver *on my PC*.

The security options are pretty decent - I can let people in my "friends" group see my porn directory, but my "family" group doesn't even have to know it exists.  (Well, I suppose they will after reading this, but they still don't get to see it.)  :P  And no one can see my Windows directory (not even me, until I'm confident enough to enable remote access for myself).

Now the next problem is dealing with this stupid dynamic DNS stuff and the fact that Cox blocks port 80.  I'm hoping myserver.org will help me with that.
