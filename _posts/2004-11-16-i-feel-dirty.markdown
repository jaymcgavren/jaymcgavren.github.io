I just posted a bunch of eBay auctions in an effort to boost my feedback rating before I make a big sale...  I went through completed auctions to determine which drew the most bids, and wound up determining that it was important to use lots of <b>bold</b>, <u>underlines</u>, and <font size="+3">really BIG text with a smattering of ALL CAPS and <font color="green">obnoxious</font> <font color="red">colors</font></font>.  I didn't go so far as to use the BLINK tag, but maybe I should've.  :P
