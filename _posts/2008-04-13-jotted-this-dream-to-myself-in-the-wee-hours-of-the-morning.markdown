The baby woke me up about 2:40 AM, so I can recall the dream I was having...  Diana, Judy and I are all living on some kind of air platform with a whole city-full of other people, and the bottom level was about to fall off.  I was scrambling to get my company's data backed-up to CDs, including data for some game a co-worker was working on, so it wouldn't be lost.
