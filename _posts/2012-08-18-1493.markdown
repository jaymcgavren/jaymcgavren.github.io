When I realized kids were posting "Let's Play..." videos of NES games on YouTube, I did a quick search...  Yup!  Someone did Ganon's Revenge back in 2009.  He slogs through 5 videos' worth of the game, and at one point calls me a "jerk" for hiding the wooden sword.  :)  The whole series seems to have gotten about 200 viewers, too.  I think he finally gave up after the fifth video, though.  :(  I was never proud of not being able to edit the dungeons, and it looks like he wasn't impressed with that aspect.  Ah, well.

So then I search for Metroid X...

Holy crap!  A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL82E4B4C2B8AD4947&feature=plcp">12-video playlist</a>!

With quotes like <em>this</em> in the comments!

> it was the first time I ever played any metroid game so I thought that metroid X was a real NES game made by nintendo, like a sequel or something.

> Afterï»¿ the the long awkward first screen I got into it, and I think I liked it more than the original.
