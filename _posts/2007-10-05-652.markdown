Remember those kamikaze guys with the bombs in Serious Sam?  Well, that's what my Halo technique has been reduced to.

EEEEEYYYYAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH<em>Thoom!</em>

I rush the crowd of Brutes (I counted at least a dozen) and their #$@!@##$@ tank, toss my two grenades (bad guys fly every which way), and then kill as many as I can with my assault rifle before I'm shot from 3 sides at once.  (It takes the AI a moment to realize that I actually am being that stupid.)  Respawn at Diana's sniper nest (with 2 new grenades), repeat.
