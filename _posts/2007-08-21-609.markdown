OK, I've been playing around with Ruby's YAML library, and have confirmed that I need to take Procs out of Zyps.  YAML has no problem serializing a Proc, but the moment it tries to load it again, I'm hit with:

<pre>Error: allocator undefined for Proc</pre>

This is probably why things blew up when I experimented with setting up a server with DRb (which I believe sends YAML over the wire).  Everything was fine until I created a creature with a Behavior.  Never got a real error from that, though; it just locked up.

:::sigh:::  Too bad, Procs are such a cool idea...  I should probably be blaming the YAML and DRb libraries instead, but I need them more than I need Procs.
