Rock Band has "Won't Get Fooled Again"?!  Holy crap.  We really need to finish tour mode.

<blockquote>
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
</blockquote>

Remember my earlier rant about karaoke song quality?  Definitely doesn't apply to Harmonix.  In fact, now that I know just how hard it is to get the rights to these songs and get the lyrics and timings right, I appreciate them a lot more.

(I'm also appreciating The Who more.)
