I'm flailing.  I have a change where I'd have to write twice as much unit test code as actual code, so I skipped the unit test, and now I'm flailing: ordering my son's birthday cake, catching up on my RSS feeds, posting to my journal, anything but actually writing the code.  It's like taking twice as long to cross a bridge because there's no handrail.

Lesson: always write the unit test first, even if it's ugly and inefficient.  You'll save yourself time later.
