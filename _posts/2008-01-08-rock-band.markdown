I can't believe I actually want this.  I never touched Guitar Hero, and I suck at DrumMania.  But it's fun as hell.  You get a room full of people, and they'll all be able to participate, even if it's just holding up lighters, singing backup, or jeering.  Now, how to justify that $200 price tag to myself?
