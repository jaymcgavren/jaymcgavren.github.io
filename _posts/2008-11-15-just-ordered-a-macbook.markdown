I've been talking about it for over a year, and I finally ordered a MacBook.  ($1000 refurbished by Apple, Intel Dual Core, 2GB RAM.)

I made myself wait a week first, but pretty much everyone at work owns one and brings it in to the shop, so I could finally stand it no longer.  These guys code with a fleet-fingered ease that I'll only be able to match if I can practice at home.
