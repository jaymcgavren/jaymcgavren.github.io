Katrina came over to help us move crap around and make room for baby furniture this weekend.  Her daughter Madison is Lenny's on-again/off-again "girlfriend" at preschool.

Well I guess they're getting serious, because we learned that last week Lenny gave her a rock.  (But of course, it was of the igneous variety.)
