Lessee...

* AJAXey goodness.
* Management for photos, audio, and video as well as text/journal entries.
* A single RSS (er, Atom) feed for all my friends.  (Not sure if that will contain their photos as well as their writings.)
* Bulleted lists.  :)


I am definitely liking this Vox thing.  If there's a tool to let me import my LiveJournal posts, I'm switching and never looking back.
