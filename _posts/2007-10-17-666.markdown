My latest way to make Windows play nice with Linux is to paste in files via the terminal.  I do:

<pre>
$ cat &gt; file.txt
[pasted content]
^D
$</pre>

That Control-D ends the file and puts me back at a prompt, with [pasted content] saved safely in file.txt.

Well, I just realized the same thing will work with xargs.  I had some noisy terminal output that contained some file names I needed to delete.  I copied it out, pasted it to my favorite text editor, played around with it until only file names were left, and then did this:

<pre>
$ cat | xargs rm
[pasted file names]
^D
$</pre>

And voila - the files are gone.  I haven't used this (or xargs) extensively, so try at your own risk, but it seems to work nice so far.
