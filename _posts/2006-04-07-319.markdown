"Find all movies directed by Kurosawa Akira, allowing search in Kanji or Romaji."

That was the use case (think "wish list item") I came up with for my media server.  I had no idea at the time how I was going to implement it, but I wrote it down anyway.

Well, I was going down the list, marking off the cases that could be implemented with my planned system, and my jaw dropped when I got this one.  My God!  I can do this!
