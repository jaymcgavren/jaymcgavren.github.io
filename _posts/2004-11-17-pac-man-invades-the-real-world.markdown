Strap on your VR goggles (and inertial sensors and GPS tracker), kids!  It's time to play Pac-Man!

While this particular application is pretty dorky, I like the whole "enhanced-reality" approach these folks have taken.  The dots are merely overlays on visuals of the real world.  This proof of concept is cumbersome at best, but when all this technology gets integrated into our cell phones, games like this might actually go mainstream.  And there are real-world applications (like giving directions to an address), as well.  (Directional beacons, here I come!)
