Dawn of the Dead was freaking awesome - A premise as creepy as the original, but with a much needed update to the makeup work.  (Blueface, anyone?)  I felt like it ripped off 28 Days Later for a lot of its visual style, but it's a damn good film on its own merits.  We're talking all-time top 10 good.

Gothika wasn't too original, and there was at least one plot hole big enough to drive a truck through.

Cabin Fever - A decent story, but the cast is unremarkable.  And you know how every horror film has that asshole/snob/ditz that you hope is the first to die?  *Every character* is like that here.  Rent this one if you want to have your faith in humanity shredded.
