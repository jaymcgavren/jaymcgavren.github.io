I know nothing about Jack Kerouac, but a commenter quoted him in a friend's blog, and I found it compelling...

"...the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn..."
