So the program blew up when we tried to install it Monday.  Now I have to worry about fixing the bugs, whether they'll can the project, and whether they'll lay me off if they do so.  I can't sit down and think about it because I've also got last minute shopping and preparations for the trip to worry about.  I didn't get to sleep until 2 AM for the last two nights in a row.  I am not happy.
