Wiimote and nunchuk attachment required.  (I haven't used either extensively, so I may be assuming they're more capable than they are...)

Each control represents one of your arms, which you can position/wave wherever you like.  Press a trigger to close a fist on that arm, release it to open the fist.  Contact an object with a closed fist to punch it.  Close a fist while in contact with an object to grab it and wave it around.  Open a fist while holding an object to release it/throw it.

"Object", by the way, can be a chair, gun, enemy, or whatever else.  "Wave it around" can mean use it as a shield, toss it into an enemy, or throw it off a rooftop.  This can lead to lovely mechanics like picking up an enemy, smacking him a few times with the chair in your other hand, using him as a human shield against a few bullets, and finally tossing him headlong into the guy that's firing at you.

Ah, gets my adrenaline pumping just thinking about it.  Substitute robots for people if you don't want an M rating.
