My Christmas present from Dad finally got in at the book store, and he handed it to me as soon as we were off the plane.  (Dad also ordered a second copy for himself.)  It's about presenting information for rapid consumption, and Tufte practices what he preaches; I took in all the key points on the flight home.  (I'll be keeping it around for reference, of course.)
