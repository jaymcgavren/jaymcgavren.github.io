Posted (in vain, I'm sure) to Sen. Jon Kyl's Facebook wall:

<blockquote>
I'm a productive, tax-paying, native-born American with inadequate health insurance for myself and my family.  Oh, we tried to purchase private insurance, but no one will underwrite us because my wife had major surgery too recently.  We wound up having to settle for a $250-a-month out-of-pocket plan.  We pay an additional $300 a month for medications because there's no prescription benefit.

I've gone from contractor to salaried status with my employer, so the situation will improve for me.  In June, when my benefits start.  Until then, I have to wait and worry about my family.

Senator Kyl, I ask you, is this an acceptable situation?  Is it acceptable for the millions of Americans who won't have a reprieve in a few months?

-Jay McGavren, Mesa

Given <a href="http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=26721&amp;type=category&amp;category=38&amp;go.x=9&amp;go.y=8">Kyl's voting record on this issue</a> I doubt it will even be read.  By Senator Kyl, that is.  But at least it'll make the topic a little harder for him to ignore.

I did this as part of <a href="http://pol.moveon.org/virtualmarch10/action.html?rc=homepage">MoveOn.org's virtual march for healthcare reform</a>.  Please consider doing the same!
