Jemini is a Ruby-based framework for game development. In this screencast, we'll create a shooter game from scratch.

Part 1 shows creating a project, setting up a game state, loading animations, music and sound effects, and setting up keyboard input and event handlers. (Not bad for 22 minutes, right?)
