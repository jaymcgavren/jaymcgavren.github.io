I've got one of the tunes from Lenny's stupid (stupid, stupid, stupid!) cell phone toy in my head...  It consists of the synthesized voice of a cat, meowing out "Pop Goes the Weasel".

Do you think that if I stuck a red hot poker in the right part of my brain, I could burn away all memory of that song?
