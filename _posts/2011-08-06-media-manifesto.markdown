A friend asked me by e-mail what I was passionate about.  When I had completed my long-winded answer, I realized that while I think endlessly about my life goal, I had never really written it down before.  So, I've included it here.

> My contribution to this whole mess is going to be tools that enable creative expression.  So far it's been the direct creation of art - generative art and game libraries.  But the world is <em>most</em> lacking in tools that allow people to share what they've made (and make a living doing it).  Sure, there are publication channels like Amazon and the iTunes Store, but you usually have to design what you're making to fit the channel.

> I want people to be able to write a book or a song, mark it as available for sale, and that's all they have to do.  Software should take care of publishing it to a website AND the Android Marketplace AND future channels that haven't been invented yet.  It should take care of promoting your work directly to people who are interested, and it should gather payments for you from all these places and plop them into your bank account.  It should also give you feedback on who likes your work and why.  If you want to publish your work for free, or allow others to remix it, the same tools should allow you to do that.
