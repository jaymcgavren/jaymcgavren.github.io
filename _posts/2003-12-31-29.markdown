Tim Berners-Lee has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3357073.stm">knighted</a> for his invention of the World Wide Web.  This puts him in the company of Sir Isaac Newton, among others, and I'd say he deserves it.

As far as I know, Sir Berners-Lee still drives an old Volkswagen to work every day, though.  :)
