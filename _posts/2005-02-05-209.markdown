I hadn't figured on being able to introduce Lenny to anime (Hayao Miyazaki, no less) at two and a half years old, but lo and behold, there he was this evening, holding the DVD of Panda Kopanda and asking to see it.  It's about right for his age, so I popped it in.  He's sitting in front of the TV right now, transfixed.
