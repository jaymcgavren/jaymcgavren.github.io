Goddamn, you mean to tell me the difference between full-screen and windowed in (Ruby) SDL is from this:

{% highlight ruby %}
SDL::setVideoMode(640,480,16,SDL::SWSURFACE)
{% endhighlight %}

...to this?

{% highlight ruby %}
SDL::setVideoMode(640,480,16,SDL::FULLSCREEN)
{% endhighlight %}

I'm going to like this framework, even if the English documentation is crap right now.
