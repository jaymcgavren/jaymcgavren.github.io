Got the XBox 360...  Not only have I not purchased any games on an actual disc yet, I don't really care.  Everything I'm playing has been downloaded to the hard drive (some actually purchased, some just demos).

I'm actually annoyed at the prospect of having to go pop a disc in once we buy something bigger.  Downloads are definitely the future.
