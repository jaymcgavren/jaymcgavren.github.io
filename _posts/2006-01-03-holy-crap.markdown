&gt; From: Me
&gt; To: Gary
&gt; Subject: Holy crap...
&gt;
&gt; $ rm -r /cvs
&gt; rm: remove write-protected regular file
&gt; '/cvs/foobar/Attic/DateComparator.java,v'?
&gt; ^C
&gt;
&gt; Can you help me figure out how much damage I did?
&gt;

For those who don't know, CVS is a program used for storing source code.  An entire development department's source code is usually stored in a single directory.  And "rm -r" nukes entire directories (and all subdirectories).

Someone up there must like me, because that "write-protected file" was the very first thing it hit, and I cancelled it immediately.  Otherwise, it would have nuked the entire department's work (for the day, at least).  In Gary's words, they would have had to string me up.
