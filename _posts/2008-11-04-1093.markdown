SMSed a bunch of people to get out and vote; a bunch have already responded that they're done.

I hear poll lines are huge in Phoenix; Mesa's less so.  Moot point for Diana and I, as we're signed up to get ballots by mail.  (Arizonans can request that service <a href="https://recorder.maricopa.gov/earlyvoteballotnet/permanentevlist.aspx">here</a>.)
