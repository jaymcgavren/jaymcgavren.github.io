Got Ruby running on the dev Solaris box at work.  Couldn't install to home, as my disk quota there is miniscule, but there's a tools area where we can basically put anything we want, so that's where it went.  Gems are running, and Rails would be too if I could get the Informix library compiled.  (I guess only the 64-bit SDK is installed, and I need 32-bit.)

Working in rSpec proper is a much nicer and more stable experience than using the story runner, that's for sure.  I'll revisit stories once the API stabilizes and is properly documented.
