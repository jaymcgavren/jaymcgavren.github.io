This is a test post from the FireFox "search" plugin I just wrote.  It sucks having to type an entry in such a tiny box (and there's no mood or music options), but it might be good for quick posts.

<b>Edit:</b> Whoops; it's not working so good.  It fills in the form, but I have to submit it manually.  Oh, well.  I should just get a paid account so I can post by e-mail...
