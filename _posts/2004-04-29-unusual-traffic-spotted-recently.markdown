Seen by me:
-A trailer carrying four dozen 6' x 5' x 3" sandstone slabs, presumably for use in decorative walls.
-A trailer carrying an Army helicopter chassis, with the blades, nose, and tail removed and a bright orange sticker of a face with a sly, sharp-toothed smile on the front.

Seen by Diana:
-A black van escorted by six men riding black motorcycles, dressed all in black, with black helmets, all bearing the American Express ExpressPay logo.
