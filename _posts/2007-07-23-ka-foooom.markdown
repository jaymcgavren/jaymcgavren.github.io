Bomberman Live is so %$#@%$@#%$@#%$#@%$#@%$#@%#@ing awesome!  It's very nice not to have to gather 4+ people and their SNES controllers at one house.

Of course, we're still plagued by the connection issues we've always had on XBox Live games.  At least we confirmed last night that persistence pays off when trying to establish a session.
