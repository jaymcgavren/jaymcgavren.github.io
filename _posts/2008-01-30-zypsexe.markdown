Yesssss!  This is the stage I was hoping to get to - the Zyps GUI compiles painlessly with rubyscript2exe.  This means I can distribute to anyone with a Windows machine.  (And maybe OS X as well.)

I still need to set up an installer/uninstaller before I can send to any download sites, but you can try it right now - just save and run this .exe.  It [em]should[/em] be easy enough to figure out on your own (and if it's not, add a comment or e-mail me).
