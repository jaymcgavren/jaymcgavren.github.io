This is a test post from my new Ruby script, which talks to WordPress over XML-RPC.  Based on a sample from <a href="http://textsnippets.com/posts/show/94">here</a>.  And to think I almost used (shudder) <a href="http://johnbokma.com/mexit/2006/07/06/perl-post-wordpress-xml-rpc.html">Perl</a>.

Why I didn't find out about this sooner, I don't know.  I'm still not happy with the WordPress documentation.
