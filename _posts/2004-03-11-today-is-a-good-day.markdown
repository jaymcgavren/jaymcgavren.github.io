The manager for Professional Services just stopped by my cube, introduced herself, and told me a couple of the programmers from my previous project had given her my name.  She has a developer position for Java Server Pages opening up, and she encouraged me to apply.  Looks like I've got the inside track.

JSP is pretty brainless stuff, but the position is more respectable than what I have now.  It *might* pay better, too.

I'm gonna go for it.  It might bolster my chances with Product Development (or with another company) a year from now.
