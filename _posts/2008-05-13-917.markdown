Logan Barnett was (rightly) horrified to see during my presentation that I was still using a Windows command prompt...  He pointed me to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console">Console 2.0</a>.

Sweet!  I've long been wondering how I could get PuTTY or the Gnome Terminal working on Windows (without resorting to CygWin).  This is every bit as good.
