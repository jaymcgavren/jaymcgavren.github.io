WhiteCap 5 is absolutely beautiful.  I haven't messed with it (or any visualizer) since, oh, version 2.0.  Bought the Gold version of that and G-Force, and then never touched them.  I barely have time to listen to music these days, much less trip out to a screensaver while I do it.

Hmmm, speaking of G-Force, that's next...

...and I need to create an EnvironmentalFactor for Zyps that manages the colors of all GameObjects according to their Location (for rainbows and such).
