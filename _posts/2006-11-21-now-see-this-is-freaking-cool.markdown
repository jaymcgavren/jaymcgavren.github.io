Vox is doing a really good job integrating varying media.  Let's say I went on a trip, and I took some photos, shot some video, and recorded some audio.  Before, when I wanted to share it with everyone, my workflow went like this:

-Write a LiveJournal entry recounting the experience.
-Upload photos to Flickr.
-Upload movies to YouTube (actually, I don't even do this part).
-Upload audio to...  well, I don't do that either.
-Copy the journal entry to an e-mail for my family ('cause they don't read my journal).

Now, Vox has potentially reduced the whole thing to this:

-Recount the experience in an e-mail, attach the photos, movies, and audio, and send it to my family, with a BCC to my special Vox posting address.

On Vox, the whole thing will be packaged up in a single nice journal entry.  On top of that, the images will appear on my images page, the movies on my movies page, and the audio on my audio page (which can also be subscribed to as a podcast).

Hot damn, this is nice.  Where the hell is my LiveJournal importer?!
