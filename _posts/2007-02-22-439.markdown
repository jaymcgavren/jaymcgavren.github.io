Finally back at the office after more than a week of telecommuting...  Nice to have an enforced break from diaper changing every 2 hours.  I feel bad for Diana though, 'cause she took all the shifts last night so I could get some sleep.

That's been the last 2 weeks for me; I'm tired, but anytime I take a break I'm too busy feeling guilty to relax.

At least I successfully got Jeremy into the baby carrier last night.  He's happy because he's with an adult, and I'm happy because I have two hands free.  Mouse and keyboard *at the same time*!  What a luxury!

My mom's staying through Monday, so hopefully Diana can get some rest.  Mom's been a huge help with the housework, even if she does leave the counters in a mess sometimes.  Now, as long as she doesn't drop the baby on his head...
