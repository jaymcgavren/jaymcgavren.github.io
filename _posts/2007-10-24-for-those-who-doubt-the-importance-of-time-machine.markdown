Just overheard a co-worker saying he has <em>no</em> pictures of his kids prior to age 5 - they were all lost in a hard drive crash.  (The backup CDs had disappeared.)  I think I have an okay solution with the Subversion repository, but I'm starting to have my doubts.

Fortunately, I am also utilizing the ultimate backup solution - paper.  A 2003-2007 family album has already been printed via Snapfish (at an exorbitant time and money cost, but damn, the result looks nice), as well as a large number of 4x6 prints.  This is not just for family to look at - I know that sometime, something's gonna happen to all those digital copies.

I've been trying to get a book printed of this blog as well, but no success so far.  Blurb.com's blog slurper is, frankly, crap - I had to export from my site to a wordpress.com account just to use it, it's slow as hell, there's no formatting options for auto-population, and they can't even print a book large enough to capture my whole blog in one go.  There was another alternative a year or so ago, but they went out of business.  I may just have to stock up on inkjet cartridges.  Frustrating.
