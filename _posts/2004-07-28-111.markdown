Just got off a conference call with the developers in India.  Veena, the technical lead, usually heads up the discussion, and I can understand her just fine.  But then she put Harish on, who needed to ask some technical question, and I swear all I heard was: "muttermuttermutter prompt muttermuttermutter code muttermuttermutter that?"  It didn't help that this was over a staticky trans-Pacific connection.  All I could do was stammer "Uh, can you repeat that?"  Finally Veena interjected that she thought they could answer his question on their end.

Wonder if any of the local colleges offer a class in Hindi?
