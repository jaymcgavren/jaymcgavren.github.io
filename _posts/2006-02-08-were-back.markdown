What happened at the wedding:
-Mom got Lenny (our ringbearer) to the ceremony site 10 minutes after we were supposed to begin.  Glen and John rushed to get him into his tux.
-Lenny then balked at walking down the aisle with all those people there.  After a lot of encouragement and what seemed an eternity, he ran up to me at the altar.
-I forgot my vows, and stumbled when reading them from my cheat sheet.  Diana did the same.
-Diana was the most beautiful I've ever seen her (and that's saying a lot).

What happened on the honeymoon:
-We dodged chickens left and right (the island is "infested" with them, according to one tour guide).
-At various times, we ordered saimin (ramen soup) from a McDonald's drive-thru, ate sushi from a conveyor, and had the most delicious (in fact the only) blue marlin I've ever had.
-We got to reconnect with each other, without any kids, bills, or work to get in the way.
-There are various other details, but I won't trouble you with them.
