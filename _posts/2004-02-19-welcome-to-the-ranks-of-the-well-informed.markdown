I finally got off my butt and set up an RSS reader.  Behold:

http://spook.myserver.org/text/news.htm

Slashdot, Roger Ebert, Dave Barry, CNN, MegaTokyo, and *you* (yup, all LiveJournals have RSS feeds), all summarized on one page, with links to the original articles/posts.  It'll be a few hours old by the time you see it; I still need to set it up as a scheduled task to keep it fresh.

Say, Eric, I notice that both PostNuke (MoMaMag) and Invision Power Board (MoMaBBS) have RSS capability if you install the right versions/modules...
