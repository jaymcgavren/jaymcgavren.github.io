If you haven't experimented with the online photo printing services, now would be a good time to start.  I simply selected all my starred photos in Picasa, clicked the "order prints" button, and they were uploaded to the service of my choice (SnapFish) for printing.

$90 got us about 600 4x6 prints, and since it was only our best work, anyone flipping through them should be sufficiently wowed.  (And no guilt for throwing away crappy shots that you paid money to have developed.)  In one fell swoop, it eliminates the last remaining weakness of going digital: no physical prints for people to flip through.

Oh, and we also created a photo book of our honeymoon, with one for the wedding soon to follow.  Not manually affixing photos into an album is a Good Thing.
