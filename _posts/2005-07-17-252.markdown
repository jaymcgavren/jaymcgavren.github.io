From the AudioScrobbler listener group <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/group/Radioheads_Not_Our_Top_Artist">Radioheads_Not_Our_Top_Artist</a>:

&gt; We don't hate Radiohead. We just think it's weird that they
&gt; are the number one artist of practically everyone using
&gt; audioscrobbler (English speakers, anyway.)
&gt;
&gt; So, the only prerequisite for joining this group is that
&gt; your #1 Top Artist isn't Radiohead.

And here's their artist statistics...
