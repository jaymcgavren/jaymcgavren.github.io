One of my co-workers used to work for Boule, a French IT company, and had to work with a lot of technical documentation in French.  At one point he came across this lovely phrase:

La compilateur pedale dans le chacr√¥ute.
The compiler is pedalling in sauerkraut.

Evidently "pedalling in sauerkraut" is an idiom meaning "not getting anywhere".  I'd like to know how they came up with that one...
