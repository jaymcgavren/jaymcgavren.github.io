Well, it looks like I don't escape this downturn unscathed.  Integrum just laid off half their staff, including me.

Three guys were suddenly called into one office for a meeting.  The rest of us were called into the board room.  "Oh, no," I thought, "they're laying them off and this is to apprise us of the situation and reassure us that we still have jobs."

Well, I was half right - the <em>larger</em> group was the one getting laid off.  My ears were actually ringing for most of this...  "There's no easy way to say this...  The first two quarters were really rough...  I hate doing this...  I'll give any of you a glowing letter of recommendation..."

The unlucky ones met up at a restaurant afterwards to talk and plan.  Those with savings were going to look into consulting and side jobs for a while.  Those without were going on unemployment and starting job hunts.  Nobody was really angry at Integrum, just numb and sad.

I'm sad too.  This was the best bunch of people I've ever been privileged to work with.  Hopefully I will be working with them more, just in other venues...
