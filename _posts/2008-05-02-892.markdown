Two Dell boxes sitting behind me in my cube...  I know at least one contains a GX755 with 2GB RAM, intended as a replacement for my Linux box.  Hopefully the other contains the same, but with XP, as that would be the cure for my dragging Eclipse environment.

No time to mess with either one today, though.  Gotta get this project debugged and running <em>yesterday</em>.
