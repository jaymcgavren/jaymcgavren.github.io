Because I'm lazy, here's a copy-paste from my post to <a href="http://cafe.gomorning.com/">Morning Cafe</a>:

My wife is so cool - she hit thinkgeek.com for my presents.  I got a shirt with Pi to 4493 digits, a set of neodymium magnets (finally, something that will actually hold papers on the fridge), and a cold soldering iron.  The clippy iPod Shuffle didn't come from ThinkGeek, but is still damn cool (and won't fall out of my pocket like the last one did).

My son (age 4) asked for a "Batman kitchen".  He evidently doesn't know that they make Dora and Barbie play kitchens, but not Batman kitchens.  Well, Santa came though - he got a Batman AND Spiderman AND Superman kitchen.  (We found a generic one and some decals to put on it.)
