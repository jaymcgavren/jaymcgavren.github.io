Our ancestors spent most of their day on their feet.  If they wanted something to eat, they hunted it, scoured the forest for it, or worked their fields to grow it.  If they wanted to go somewhere, they walked.  If they wanted something another person had made, they bartered a physical item that they had made with their own sweat and toil.

I spend most of my day sitting on my ass.  If I want something to eat, I walk to the refrigerator.  If I want to go somewhere, I drive my car.  If I want something another person has made, I pay money earned with great mental exertion, but almost no physical exertion.

As a result, I am fat and weak, and by standards of natural selection I do not deserve to live.

Today I have decided I am going to rectify this situation.
