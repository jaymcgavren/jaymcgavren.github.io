There was a dark blue felt-covered easy chair, sitting upside down in the middle of the 101.

Fortunately, traffic was moving pretty slowly due to rush hour, so motorists were steering around it without much trouble.  It would have caused a serious accident at any other time of day.

I considered pulling over and dragging it off the road, but given some of the stories I'd heard, I realized that was a good way to get killed.
