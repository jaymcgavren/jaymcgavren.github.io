Rode along to Six Flags with Jennifer and Bryan - lotta fun. The wait for the X2 was ridiculous, especially considering it was like a 90 second ride, and there were zero lines for the rest of the coasters.  At least we got some cool photos while in line...  The Flip Mino video camera I got as a Christmas present from Integrum took some impressive video while on the coasters themselves.  (Er, that is, it would have, if we had broken the rules and brought it, which we would <em>never</em> do.)

In a happy coincidence, Eric and Hitomi just moved less than an hour away from there, so we got to combine trips and visit them.  We didn't get to do conveyor sushi (that restaurant was tiny and packed) but we hit another sushi place, and even Jennifer and Bryan tried some sashimi.  (Pretty brave considering Bryan got some bad fish a while ago.)

On the way back Diana fought her way into a crowded outlet mall and emerged with one of those shamelessly self-branded Coach purses for $70 (which I'm assured is a great price).  Hey, if she can get her shopping fix at a discount, I'm all for it.

I've always flown into LA in the past, so I didn't know the drive was so beautiful.  Pasadena, especially, is a place I'd like to go back and visit at some point.  Guess that's next trip!
