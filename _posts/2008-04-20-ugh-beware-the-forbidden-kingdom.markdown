Jet Li and Jackie Chan kicking each others' asses is marvelous in concept (and in the one scene where it actually happens).  Too bad most of the film is devoted to sending the Karate Kid back in time to ancient China.  (Gee, wonder why that was missing from the previews?)

The scenes that <em>don't</em> feature Ralph Macchio's young clone are epic and beautiful.  The scenes that <em>do</em> are too many to ignore.
