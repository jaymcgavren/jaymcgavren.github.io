Yay!  Dreamhost just added PHPbb 3.0 to their 1-click installs page!  (Yes, I could probably do an install myself, but I have better things to do with my time.)  Just waiting for the notification to come through from the "installer robot".

This should take care of my spammer problems.  Zyps can have a forum now!
