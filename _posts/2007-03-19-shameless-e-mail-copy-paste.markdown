&gt; We've been encommunicado for a while, so just wanted to let
&gt; everyone know we're doing well...
&gt;
&gt; Jeremy is growing at an amazing (alarming?) rate,
&gt; approaching 9 pounds now.  The difference from the delivery
&gt; pictures is noticeable.  (I'll get new ones posted soon.)
&gt; He's been pulling himself up on his arms to look around
&gt; since almost day one, something he's not supposed to be
&gt; able to do for a couple months.  (Still kinda wobbly,
&gt; though.)
&gt;
&gt; Sleep is still a rare commodity at the house, with Diana
&gt; losing the most thanks to feedings.  She's been a real
&gt; trooper, though, and of course I try to pitch in with the
&gt; bottle when I'm not at work.  Every now and then the baby
&gt; will sleep 4 or 5 hours at a stretch, which is a welcome
&gt; respite.  Mom and Dad have each made trips here, and both
&gt; have been huge helps, as has Judy.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, that's us.  How are all of you?  News from the
&gt; outside world would be nice, as we don't get to see it that
&gt; often these days.  :)
