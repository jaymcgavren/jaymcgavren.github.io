Last night the winning bidder for one of my eBay auctions who happens to live in the area came to pick up and pay for his Super Nintendo game.  This one was for the Starfox Super Weekend cartridge (a special three-level version of the game Nintendo made for a competition back in '93 or '94).  The price - a cool $220, paid in cash.  I think I originally paid $20 for this thing.  That's not all; Earthbound and Mega Man X2 each brought in about $50, and I raked in almost $400 in all.  Not a bad haul.
