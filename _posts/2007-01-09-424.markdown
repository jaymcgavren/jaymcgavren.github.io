Annnnd...  the car's back from the shop.  $60 to find that a bolt was missing <i>from the brake assembly</i> and replace it.  It wasn't the CV joint at all.

Did I mention the last people to work on the brakes were my father in law and myself?  And I doubt the mistake was my father in law's.  I really need to stick to coding.
