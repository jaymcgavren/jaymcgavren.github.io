I made the foolish mistake of looking for wedding venues first, figuring we'd get a loan "somehow".  After a week of running all over town on her vacation, Diana chose a beautiful but still somewhat reasonably-priced hotel, but she was reduced to tears tonight when I actually looked at loan options and determined we could only get half what we needed.

Tomorrow she'll start her venue search again, while I look for more financing options, both of us with lowered expectations and a more somber mood.
