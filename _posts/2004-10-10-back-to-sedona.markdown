Diana was off school this week, so I took a couple days off as well, and we headed back to Sedona.  We got some pretty good photos, and I experimented more with PT Assembler (the panorama software).

Most of them didn't turn out so well (too many exposure differences), but this one's nice:

Here's the whole batch:
