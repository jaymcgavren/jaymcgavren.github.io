Diana's ob-gyn OKed our discharge this morning.  We can take our time getting out the door though, so we're building up the energy.  (I've actually had it relatively easy, sleeping 4 hours at a stretch sometimes.  Diana's had to do feedings every 2-3 hours or so, on top of all the interruptions from hospital staff.)

The baby is adorable.  When he was first born he did nothing but coo and whine.  He cries more often now, but even then we get a grace period of grunts beforehand.  He's got a thin layer of blonde hair and (for now) deep blue eyes, with which he'll gaze at you with an intensity you can't help but grin at.
