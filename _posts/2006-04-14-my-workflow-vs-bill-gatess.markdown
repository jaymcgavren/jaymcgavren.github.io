&gt; How I Work: Bill Gates
&gt; FORTUNE Magazine
&gt; Bill Gates, chairman and chief software architect,
&gt; Microsoft, U.S.A.
&gt; April 7, 2006: 5:17 PM EDT

&gt; At Microsoft, e-mail is the medium of choice, more than
&gt; phone calls, documents, blogs, bulletin boards, or even
&gt; meetings (voicemails and faxes are actually integrated into
&gt; our e-mail in-boxes).

I wish my workplace was like this.  Leaving me voice mail is a good way to get ignored.

&gt; I'm not big on to-do lists. Instead, I use e-mail and
&gt; desktop folders and my online calendar.

Same here, though I'm actually looking to integrate e-mail and calendar with a to-do list instead of vice-versa.

&gt; using SharePoint, a tool that creates websites for
&gt; collaboration on specific projects. These sites contain
&gt; plans, schedules, discussion boards, and other information

AKA Wiki, right?  Again, something I wish my workplace would do.

&gt; Another digital tool that has had a big effect on my
&gt; productivity is desktop search. It has transformed the way
&gt; I access information on my PC, on servers, and on the
&gt; Internet.

Damn right.  I saved all my e-mail for later searching even before I had Google Desktop Search.

&gt; If the entire week is very busy, it's the weekend when I'll
&gt; send the long, thoughtful pieces of e-mail.

I wish I was Bill Gates.  Then people would actually read my long, thoughtful e-mails, instead of asking me stupid questions the next week.
