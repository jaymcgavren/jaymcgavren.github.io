<a href="http://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20070821/second-thoughts-are-real">"researchers now say last-minute second thoughts come from a specific part of the brain."</a>

I remembered this article last night after taking advantage of Halo 3's feature where you have 5 seconds to abort just after hitting the "start game" menu.  Someone at Bungie is keeping up on their cognitive psychology.

(Actually this feature's been around since Halo 2, which predates this particular study.  But that feature wasn't thrown in at random, and the study vindicates it.)

Finished Legendary on Saturday. Collected the last of the skulls last night.

I told Diana she has to let me sleep now.
