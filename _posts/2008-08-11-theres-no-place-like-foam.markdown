I know my opinion is going to be unpopular at the time of this writing, but I consider the average Western-style home to be a form of litter.  They cover the landscape, are unsightly unless carefully maintained, and must be cleaned up when no longer needed.

So I consider the <a href="http://www.pinktentacle.com/2008/08/styrofoam-dome-homes/">styrofoam house</a> to be a step in the right direction.  Sure, they're not much good in a tornado, but the owner could just head for a shelter (and I wouldn't want to be in anything <em>else</em> during an earthquake).  Not only that, the entire dwelling could be replaced for the cost of repairs on today's houses.

Of course, you can forget building high-rises out of the stuff (barring clever engineering?), so it still doesn't solve the problem of urban sprawl.  I think the final solution will be even more portable and disposable.
