I got my start in software development by picking up the resources I needed to solve the problems that were relevant to me.  I figure the same will be necessary to capture my son's interest.

Well, my son's mainly interested in video games.  So be it.

I spent a good part of my youth hacking NES games by re-writing small parts of the program via Game Genie.  When I learned that the Nintendo DS emulator, DeSmuME, has a facility to search and write the game's RAM to create new cheat codes, I sat down with Lenny for a hack session.

Almost everything in a video game's code is controlled by numbers.  Understand the numbers, and you begin to understand the program.  We're not there yet, but this is a great start...
