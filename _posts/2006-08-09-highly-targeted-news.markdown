1. Join del.icio.us (http://del.icio.us/).
2. Add del.icio.us bookmarks for a few of your favorite sites/articles.
3. Go to your bookmarks page, and click one or more of the "saved by X other people" links.  Choose ones with the <i>lowest</i> number of matches, because that will weed out a lot of people with tastes that differ from yours.
4. Click one or more of the user names in the "posting history" on the right.
5. Review the articles they've posted.  If you like what you see, click the "add X to your network" link at the top of the page.  Favor people who have a low overall post count (less spam), and who have posted in the last month or so (no dead accounts).
6. Go to http://del.icio.us/network to view the articles posted by everyone you've added.  There's an RSS feed link at the bottom of that page, but I can't get it to import to Google Reader at the moment.
