Diana and I finally got out to the Roaring Fork restaurant last night, to celebrate our one-year anniversary.  (We'd originally intended to go for our 6-month anniversary, but never got around to it.)

I would up dropping a total of $125 just for the two of us, but man, you get what you pay for.  The service was fantastic - in addition to being able to recommend wines, our waitress knew the meanings of the bizarre code words the cooks were shouting in the kitchen when we asked.  ("Fire 51" means to throw order 51 on the grill.)  And the food - I had the bass, Diana the venison.  Both were cooked to just the right texture, and had such marvellous flavor on their own that they didn't need any garnishes (though the apples that came with Diana's and the gravy that came with mine complemented them perfectly).

We can't afford to do this all the time, but man, I'd like to do it again.
