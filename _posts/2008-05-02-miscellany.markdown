The iTunes "Priority Electronic Music" playlist just burned a new CD for me, and it included some Stendeck...  I realized that song that had been stuck in my head for a week but couldn't remember who did it was one of his.  He's not an incredibly versatile artist, but at least I like his one style.  (Yet another track with ultra lo-fi drums and sweeping, plaintive pads...  Count me in!)

The new <a href="http://goozex.com">Goozex</a> account is working out pretty nice.  (They're a game-trading service.)  Finally, I can find good homes for the titles on the Pile of Shame that I know I'll never get back to.  Shipping stuff out is especially easy for me since I only have to stop by the mailroom.
