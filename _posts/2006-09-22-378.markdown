&gt; Did you know September is National Fruit and Vegetable
&gt; Month?  To reinforce the importance of these food groups we
&gt; encourage you to eat at least five servings of fruits and
&gt; vegetables each day throughout September.
&gt;
&gt; Each Friday, for the rest of the month, we will be
&gt; providing plates full of your favorite fruits.  Feel free
&gt; to enjoy them and pick up a flyer that outlines some of the
&gt; many benefits.

Wow...  (sniff...)  I've never worked for a company that actually cared whether I got enough fiber.
