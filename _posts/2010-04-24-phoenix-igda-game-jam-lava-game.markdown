Our in-progress game for Android phones, where you move a character around and dig trenches for lava to flow through.  Surprisingly easy work once you have the SDK installed and configured.  Works great on both an emulator and the hardware.

We have the character movement and grid of dirt squares going.  Artwork is, um, a placeholder. :)
