I thought the yoga place Diana found yesterday was a little hokey...  They had her participate in a tea ceremony, and then they used sensors and some PC software to "read her aura".  Well, whatever, I thought.  She likes yoga better than a gym membership.  I decided not to say anything.

But apparently Diana thought it was a little hokey too, because she Googled them today.  What was the first headline that came up?  "Critics Compare Dahn Yoga to Cult."  Evidently one of their members died during a training exercise on a mountain in Sedona.

At least Diana caught on before they conned her out of $1000 for a one-year membership.
