The plan was sushi, Golden Gate, jazz bar, hotel.  When Logan and Stacey and their 18-month-old joined us, it became sushi, hotel (kid needs his sleep), golden gate, jazz bar, hotel.

What finally happened, though, was french cuisine, impound lot, hotel.

<!--more-->

We parked the rental car in the one available space on Hayes near the sushi restaurant, then marched the short distance to Sebo Sushi.  We promptly learned that if we needed to seat four, there'd be an hour and a half wait.  (I later learned that Diana had wanted to eat at this place because it was the one from Anthony Bourdain's show; dunno why she didn't think we'd need reservations.)

Up the street in hopes of finding another restaurant, and we came across Absinthe.  A bit pricier, but it was there, I wanted to ensure Diana could sightsee, and dangit, I was hungry.  So in we went.

Emerged an hour later (no wait but Absinthe service was a bit slow), and marched back up the street to the place the car <em>should</em> have been parked.

Where was it?

We're in the wrong place?  No, I recognize the landmarks.  It's been stolen?  Please, that car is crap.  Maybe it's been towed?  That's when I saw the worn-away red paint on the curb, the dark underground garage gate sunk into the facade of the building, and the laminated "no parking" sign hung on it.  Four separate people in our car managed to miss seeing this thing.  At that point a car emerged from the garage, and found themselves blocked in by yet another car that was parked in the same spot.

Found the towing "service" through a combination of flagging down a cop car and calling Cha-Cha.  $350.  Called a cab to get to the lot.  Had to leave Logan and Stacey sitting on the street (they couldn't load their kid in the cab; the child seat was in the car).  Found an extra $88 citation on the windshield.  Back to pick everyone up.  Diana still hasn't gotten to see the Golden Gate, so I spent the evening consoling her in the hotel bar.  I suppose we'll be spending another $1000 on another trip back here next year.

At least there were directions to contest the ticket (and hopefully the towing fee?) on the checkout paperwork.  You can be assured we will; this place is a booby trap.
