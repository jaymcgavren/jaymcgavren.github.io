I just grabbed what I thought was the SQL Pocket Guide off my shelf, to look up some database field types.  I flipped to the index, and was surpised to see an entry for "Orwell, George".  "What is that doing in an IT handbook?", I wondered, and flipped to the entry.  It was only when I saw that it was in a section on creative writing technique that I realized I had grabbed Strunk and White's The Elements of Style (which is about the same size and shape) instead.
