Yesterday's storm didn't bring any snow here to Mesa, just lots and lots of rain.  But we did see snow on the Superstitions when we headed out this afternoon, and when we pointed it out to Lenny he *had* to touch some.  The stuff on top of the Sups was well out of hiking range.  So we drove toward Globe (an hour away), where we'd heard there was still snow on the ground.

It was getting dark, and we weren't wearing coats, so we didn't go all the way.  But there were trucks passing us in the opposite direction with snow piled into their beds, probably to take home to show families.  I spotted three sizable snowballs off to the side of the road, which had presumably fallen off a vehicle, so I told Diana to pull over.

Lenny got to crunch his boots in some, and Diana and I started the world's shortest-lived snowball fight.  We headed home with one last snowball in the car (which melted before we got there).
