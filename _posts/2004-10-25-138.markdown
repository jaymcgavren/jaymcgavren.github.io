LiveJournal never brought out that "find people based on common interests" search they were talking about, much to my disappointment.  So I did a Google to see if anyone had taken matters into their own hands.

Looks like phyxeld wrote <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/perl/36793.html">this Perl script</a> that screen scrapes your interests and then runs queries for them.  It's an unreadable mushpile, but I was able to get it running on Windows with only one change.

I can see why LJ never made it a standard feature; a single search took five minutes.  Anyway, here's what I got...

doshichan probably tops the list because I copied most of my interests from his, and, well, because we have a lot of common interests.  (That's probably the only reason we've been able to stand each other this long. :)  I don't recognize anyone else on this list, though.  Maybe it's time to make some new contacts.

If any of you non-Perl users would like me to run it for your username, let me know.
