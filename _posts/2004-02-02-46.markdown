Animal Planet: The Most Extreme is pretty cool.  They had a marathon Sunday, and we flipped back and forth between that and the Super Bowl (to see the commercials).  They pick a theme (most extreme venom, most extreme appendages) and then choose bizarre animals (or commonly known animals with bizarre traits) that follow it.  The narrator is cheesy, but you can see a lot of cool critters you probably haven't before.

Looks like I'll be voting for Clark in the primary.  I won't mind if Kerry wins, though.
