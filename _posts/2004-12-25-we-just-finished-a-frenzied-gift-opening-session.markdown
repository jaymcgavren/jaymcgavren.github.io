Lenny got more toys than he knows what to do with (the Bob the Builder ones are his favorites).  We'll probably store some and break them out bit by bit over the year.

Diana, unfortunately, found her Tivo early (when Amazon shipped it in its original box), but she's out there playing with it even now.  She also likes her Lord of the Rings: The Third Age, which we'll play together later.

We're also going to play Judy in a game of Scrabble on the new board we bought her.

Diana REALLY spoiled me: a Game Boy Advance SP with 3 games (one from Judy), a new watch to replace the one I gave Glen (since it didn't fit anymore thanks to my weight gains), and a new monitor for my PC (my old one needed to be smacked occasionally to bring it back to full brightness).
