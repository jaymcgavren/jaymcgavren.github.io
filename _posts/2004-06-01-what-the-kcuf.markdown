Last night I had a dream that I was Brad Pitt starring in a remake of Fight Club along with John Cleese.  After defeating the giant demon that was controlling the entire city, we were suspended over a 100-foot drop while Cleese's character tried to figure out a MacGyver-like contraption with some fishing wire to get us down.
