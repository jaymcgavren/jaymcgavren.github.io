Diana started clinicals today.  She was up at 4:45 A.M, and out the door at 5:30.  (After playing Fable until 11:30 last night, and then reading a novel until midnight.  She's a creature of habit.)  Judy was afraid Diana would oversleep, so she got up as well, just in case.

All this blundering about woke Lenny up, of course.  So although I'd been planning to sleep until the luxuriously late time of 6:15 AM, I instead had to rush through a shower while Judy kept an eye on him, then take over babysitting.  He was in a good enough mood this morning, but I'm sure he'll be a fussy wreck tonight from a lack of sleep.  So will Diana and I.  :(
