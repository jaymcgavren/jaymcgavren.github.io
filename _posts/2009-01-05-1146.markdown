Heard this one before, but I have new appreciation for it...

<blockquote>
On two occasions I have been asked by members of Parliament, "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?"

I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.

--Charles Babbage
