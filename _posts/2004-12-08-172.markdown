Four different developers are taking my translator model from an old project of mine and adapting it to a new hotel brand.  They're whipping through the code in no time.

I've always worked solo, so I was never sure how my code would hold up when someone else was maintaining/extending it.  It's a huge relief to see that others can actually grok it.
