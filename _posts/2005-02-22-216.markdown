I find I'm making a *lot* of typos and grammatical errors the last week or so.  I never even used to have to proofread my work.  Yesterday I did almost nothing useful, because I couldn't concentrate enough to plan my new project.

Nothing is so worrying as not being able to trust your own mind anymore.  I hope this is temporary.
