Lenny had a karate "recital" today, where they basically get up on stage and show off for a room full of parents why they've been paying $40 a month.  It was basically the same routine I've caught glimpses of week after week when dropping him off, but getting 15 four-year-olds all doing the same moves at the same time was a pretty impressive feat.

He'd stayed over with his friend Madison the night before, and afterward both families went to lunch at Denny's.  It was kind of a preview of what we were in for the next few years...  "No, you two are going to sit on opposite sides of the table."  "There, you have the exact same crayons, now you have nothing to complain about."  Considering their lack of sleep, though, they were cute and well-behaved.

Very mundane, middle-class-family stuff, but of course it's all novel to me.  It was kinda fun, a reminder of my own childhood.
