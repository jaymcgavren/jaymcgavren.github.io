I can only find the remnants of <a href="http://jay.mcgavren.com/thespook/">the site I had in the mid-90s</a> at Novia.net in Omaha.  The original was even grosser-looking, with tiling water drops rendered in POV-Ray as a background.  Maybe it's burned to a CD somewhere.  If I can ever find it I'll post it here, as a warning to my children not to code HTML by hand.
