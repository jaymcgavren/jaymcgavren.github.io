Just watched the Nature episode "Born Wild: The First Days of Life", and got a dangerously large number of ideas for an artificial life simulation.

Here are (some of) the forces that seem to be in play:

<ul>
<li>Food and energy affect all aspects of birthing strategies.  All these make it more likely at least some young will survive, but take energy in return:</li>
<ul>
<li>  Producing more than one fetus.</li>
<li>  Long gestation periods.</li>
<li>  Making yolk inside eggs.</li>
<li>  Producing milk.</li>
</ul>
<li>If you're not top of the food chain, your babies need to be born ready to run.  A longer gestational period is in order.</li>
<li>A baby can be left to fend for itself, if it's born smart enough to find food.  This means no milk production or babysitting, but probably also means longer gestation.</li>
<li>Birds let the strongest infant feed first - it's most likely to survive.  The others get the scraps and if they live too, great.  Sometimes the strongest sibling kills the weaker ones.  Sometimes the parents themselves do.</li>
<li>If the father stays to help, it brings extra food energy into the equation - he feeds the kids or sometimes the mother.  Sometimes this means bigger litters, or in the case of emperor penguins, it simply means survival.</li>
<li>Sometimes the mother herself is the food energy - one species of spider willingly lets the babies eat her alive.</li>
<li>For males, killing the cubs of your rivals is a good way to get their harems ready to mate with you.  Of course, you have to prove your genetic superiority by fighting off the father first.</li>
<li>Social animals help defend each others' young, IF they're from the same father.  Children from other groups get attacked, though.</li>
</ul>
