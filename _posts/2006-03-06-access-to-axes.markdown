Anyone able to leave their Animal Crossing town gate open tonight, so we can come get one or more axes?  We're trying to build a stockpile until such time as we can acquire a Golden Axe.  We'll also leave ours open so you can come visit (and hopefully drop one off).

The FAQ I'm reading misled me a bit...  I just buried $20,000, thinking it would either grow into a money tree, or remain a bag I could dig back up.  I was elated to see it turn into a sprout immediately.  But today it seems to be wilting!  :_(  I think I might be out $20,000.
