So with explorer.exe gone, Windows-R simply plops an "r" into the current window.  I can't tell you how many times I've done that today, instead of CapsLock-"open shell" like I'm supposed to be.  This is going to be a hard habit to unlearn.

Someday, when all my scripts are reimplemented as selection processors, I'm going to laugh at how quaint all this seems.
