My brother was browsing my files, and overwhelmed at the size of my music collection, he e-mailed me to ask if I had yanked a PC from a radio station.

I told him that if I had yanked a computer from a radio station, there would be 8 MP3s on it, set up on a loop to repeat every hour, and they would all be by Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake.  :)
