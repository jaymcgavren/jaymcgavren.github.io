Here's another interesting unintended use for Google...  Evidently many Webcams have a feature that lets you view the feed from anywhere on the Web.  Unfortunately, said feeds are completely un-password-protected by default, letting anyone who knows the URL spy on you.  No problem; just don't give out the URL, right?

Wrong.  Each camera has a standard script responsible for rendering the feed.  If you Google for the name of that script, you get a *huge* list of unsecured cameras.  Just click the link, and see who's on the other end.

Right now there's not much to see in North America (too dark/businesses are closed) so I'm watching someone's goldfish in China, and a coin laundry in Japan.
