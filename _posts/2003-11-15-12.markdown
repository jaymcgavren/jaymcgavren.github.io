We finally went to see -itis tonight...  Holy shit, these guys can rock.  I didn't care for the album I heard, but it's a totally different story live.  Never seen a band incorporate dildos into their act, either.  :P

During the show, they were offering up their albums for 10 bucks, "or have a friend burn a copy for you, we don't care."  I went ahead and bought one anyway.  Guess reverse psychology really does work.
