Christmas shopping's done (except for a gift exchange where the one thing I know my giftee will like will be difficult to find on short notice).  I got some actual sleep last night.  I have convinced myself that our program launch problems Monday really are not my fault.

My family may hate their presents, I may miss my flight, and I may yet be fired, but at least I have achieved a state of mental balance again.  I still hate Christmas, though.
