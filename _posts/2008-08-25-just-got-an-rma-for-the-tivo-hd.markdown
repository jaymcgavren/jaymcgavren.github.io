Cox's stupid Scientific Atlanta cable cards won't sync with it, and even the people who got theirs working start missing shows every 2 weeks and have to reboot (unacceptable after the smooth operation we've had with our Series 2).

No release date announced for a fix, and it looks like Scientific Atlanta is the one that needs to produce it.  (But gee, don't they have their own DVR now?  Wonder how quickly they'll move to fix the problems their competitor is having?)
