I wasn't looking forward to re-issuing fifty "learn as open x" Enso commands on each of my machines.  What I found, though, is that Enso simply stores ordinary Windows shortcuts here:

<pre>%userprofile%/My Documents/Enso's Learn As Open Commands</pre>

I was able to simply run my create_shortcuts.pl in that folder and instantly re-create all my shortcuts as open commands.  That includes stuff Enso can't create with "learn as open", like:

<pre>rundll32.exe Shell32.dll, Control_RunDLL appwiz.cpl</pre>

Not bad.  Now I'm just awaiting the ability to run Python scripts of my own design on the current selection.
