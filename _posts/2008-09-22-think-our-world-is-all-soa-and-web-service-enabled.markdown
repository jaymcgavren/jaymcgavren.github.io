Think again.  I just got an e-mail from a major travel industry vendor (one you've probably heard of), detailing changes to the procedure for manually downloading and unzipping the monthly data <em>file</em> they send us.  This is the third vendor in the past year to pull something like this.  (Actually the <em>biggest</em> one can't seem to send us the same format <em>month to month</em>.)
