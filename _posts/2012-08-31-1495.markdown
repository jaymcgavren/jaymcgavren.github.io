Some folks were messing around with a "data:text/html" URL in Campfire (paste it into your address bar to render the accompanying HTML), which I hadn't known was possible...  Well, of course I immediately had to see if other MIME types would work, and the first thing I tried was SVG...

Raw form (copy-paste in your address bar):

<pre>
data:image/svg+xml,&lt;svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'&gt;&lt;g transform="rotate(50),scale(9)"&gt;&lt;text&gt;SVG in a URL!&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
</pre>

Link form (uses entities for the angle brackets):

<a href="//www.w3.org/2000/svg'&gt;&lt;g transform='rotate(50),scale(9)'&gt;&lt;text&gt;SVG in a URL!&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;">SVG in a URL!</a>

Tested in Chrome, Safari and Firefox on OSX.  If it <em>doesn't</em> work for you (or is expected to be deprecated in the future), I'd be curious to know.
