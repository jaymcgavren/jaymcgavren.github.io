So the Lappy is officially out of commission for a week or two.  I turned my back for a second, and the screen went black, and now it won't even turn on.

I'd get a refund and buy a Dell instead, but Newegg's laptop policy is exchanges-only.  So I gotta ship it back and wait for a replacement, then set everything up from scratch again.  I'd like to wipe the hard drive on this one for security's sake, but that's a little hard when it won't power up.  Hope Newegg/Acer does it for me.
