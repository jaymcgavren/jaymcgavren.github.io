Diana likes the following things that only a male japanophile nerd would normally like, and I love her for it:

sushi
Tivo
Mahou Tsukai Tai!
HD television
Soul Calibur
Dead or Alive
Halo
Tetris Attack
Tenchi Muyo!
Howl's Moving Castle
digital photography

....there's more, but that's what comes to mind for now.
