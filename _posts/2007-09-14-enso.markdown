Ever since using the late Jef Raskin's The Humane Environment, I've been using the Windows Run menu, my "cb" (read/write clipboard) utility, and a few other scripts to do a sad, modal approximation of the THE command quasimode.

<pre>cb | less</pre>

<pre>cb | wc | less</pre>

<pre>cb | upper_case | cb</pre>

<pre>web humanized.com</pre>

Well, it looks like <a href="http://www.humanized.com/">Enso</a> is about to replace all that.  It's out, it's $20, and I just ordered it straight away after watching the demo video.  We'll see soon whether I regret that decision.
