I got turned down for the Web Developer spot.  :(  *I* was planning to turn *them* down, but it's still a bruise to the ego.

Oh, well, I wouldn't have hired me either.  :P  I'm not exactly fluent in the technologies they're after.  And the department manager left open the possibility of applying again in the future, so I must have at least been a front runner.
