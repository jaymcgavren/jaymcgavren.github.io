Diana has to follow certain procedures when taking patients down to MRI, because the magnets in the machine can disable watches and make other stuff fly across the room.  Well, I stumbled across a site that depicts what happens when you're not careful:

&gt; Flying Objects!
&gt; "Once you've been in the MRI field for any length of time,
&gt; you start hearing all of the various horror stories about
&gt; things that have flown into a scanner. Often, newcomers
&gt; don't take the real danger of flying objects seriously
&gt; until they witness an oxygen tank or gurney flying into a
&gt; magnet themselves. This page will contain a collection of
&gt; pictures and stories of metalic projectiles."
