I dreamt I was back in Omaha, driving around downtown Benson, when a thick fog began slowly tumbling over the street.  I pulled over and got out of my car to wait it out.  That was when rocks began bouncing down the hill - approaching at roughly 100 miles an hour.  I wasn't particularly freaked out at this point, I just picked one of the larger ones up and blocked a few as they approached.

Then as they approached boulder size, I sought refuge behind a tree, and then inside a house.  As the deluge passed, I was trying to figure out how I'd report to my Mom that I was okay, and then realized she was there in the house with me, doing laundry.  (She was borrowing their washer.)  I told her to stay put and went out to find my brothers.

Still no idea if this was supposed to be a volcano, or a meteor strike, or what.
