Reasons I like my new employer:

-I'm getting paid more.
-I'm not afraid the company will lay me off tomorrow.
-My hard drive is 4 times as big, my CPU twice as fast.
-My business cards are on the way.
-I don't have to buy my own desk supplies.

Yes, I had to buy my own supplies at my prior company; that was how scary their financial situation was.
