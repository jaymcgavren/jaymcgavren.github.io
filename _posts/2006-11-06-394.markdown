&gt; Glen and April's house
&gt; You're in Glen and April's house.
&gt;
&gt;  ( 2) A small straw torch sits here.
&gt;       A hooded lantern sits here.
&gt;       A boat is docked here.
&gt; A dog looks at you and whimpers excitedly.
&gt; Glen is here.
&gt; An angry Orc marches around.
&gt; A mean looking troll glares at you.
&gt; You see Glen here.
&gt; A dog looks at you and whimpers excitedly.
