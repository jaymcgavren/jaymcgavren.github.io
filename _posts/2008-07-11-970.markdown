Here's where my Safari Bookshelf sits at the moment:

<blockquote>
Cross-Platform GUI Programming with wxWidgets
By 	Julian Smart; Kevin Hock; Stefan Csomor

Design Patterns in Ruby
By 	Russ Olsen

Ruby on Rails: Up and Running
By 	Bruce A. Tate; Curt Hibbs

The Rails Way
By 	Obie Fernandez

The Ruby Way: Solutions and Techniques in Ruby Programming, Second Edition
By 	Hal Fulton
</blockquote>

I'm actually pretty much done with the wxWidgets and Rails: Up and Running books, but I generally don't delete books until I need the shelf slots.  I retrieved The Rails Way because I'm not too pleased with the organization of the Rails: Up and Running book, and besides, I need a reference more than a tutorial now.

Gonna play with my new "purchases" starting tonight, so look for impressions in the coming weeks.
