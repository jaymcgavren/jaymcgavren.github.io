I've had a copy sitting on my shelf forever.  Guess I really need to get around to reading it.

<font face="Georgia, Georgia Ref, Book Antiqua, Garamond" size="5">
You're <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>!<br />
<font size="4">by Mark Twain</font><br />
<i><font size="3">With an affinity for floating down the river, you see things in black
and white. The world is strange and new to you and the more you learn about it, the less
it makes sense. You probably speak with an accent and others have a hard time
understanding you and an even harder time taking you seriously. Nevertheless, your
adventurous spirit is admirable. You really like straw hats.</font><br />
