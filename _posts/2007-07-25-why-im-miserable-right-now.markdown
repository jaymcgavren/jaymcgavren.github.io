4gl isn't catching blatant errors (like number of arguments when opening a cursor) at compile time.Â  (Hopefully they all get caught before production...)

I have to commit my buggy code into SCCS if I want %C% replaced with line numbers in my error statements.

I have to manually check code back out after each commit, at which point the file is changed, so my editor reloads it.  I lose my place each time.
