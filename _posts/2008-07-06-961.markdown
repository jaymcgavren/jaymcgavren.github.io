It's about 6 AM, the morning after Dad and Ruth's wedding.  It was very successful.  Nice ceremony and a beautiful, beautiful reception, they rented out Lauritzen Gardens in Omaha, got a string quartet, DJ, all that good stuff.

We retired to Glen and April's with John and Lacey and cousin Chuck, just sitting out by the fire pit and yakking away.  A really nice time, but unfortunately now we have to be up in time to get to an 11:30 AM brunch and we're probably gonna be tired as hell.  Oh, well I had a nice time and it's well worth it.
