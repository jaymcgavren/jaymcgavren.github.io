As I passed a pay phone today, my first thought was: "Hmmm, a hard line.  I'd better remember that's there."  (I've been playing The Matrix: Path of Neo.)

As I may have mentioned to some of you, I've also caught myself considering what Tom Nook would pay for various items while walking through the produce section at the grocery.
