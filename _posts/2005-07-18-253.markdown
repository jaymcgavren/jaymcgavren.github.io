Diana's mom currently has EIGHT cats staying in her room, because a friend of hers sold his house before having a new one lined up.  The cats need a place to stay while he transitions.

Our sleep was disturbed by the dog, who felt compelled to bark at them from across the house when they began meowing in the middle of the night.  Judy's sleep was bascially nonexistent, because of course she was right there in the room with the meowing cats.

Oh, well, at least she's keeping them pent up in her room, rather than letting them all over the house to play havoc with my allergies (and the dog).  I wonder how long she can keep this up for, though...

I agreed to all this because I thought it was only for a week.  Then a week was added.  Then I find out it's for a MONTH after the cats are "moved in".  I'm not happy, needless to say.
