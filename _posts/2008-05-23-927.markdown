Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows (2005) is now available for download on XBox 360 Live, and I regret not catching it the first time around.  (Well, no, I think $60 might have been too much to pay for it, but for $15, it's freaking awesome.)

Basically, it's an ultra-fast-paced, Live-enabled four-player God of War.  It's not especially deep; there are invisible walls all over the place, and the strategy doesn't vary that much by enemy.  But with multiple players, it definitely requires teamwork.  "Someone cast the repulse spell!"  "Save the cheese for me!"  Diana, Lenny and I are playing it now, and it's just challenging enough to get your pulse pumping.  Good stuff.

If anyone downloads it and wants to party up, let us know.
