It seems I never just sit down and pick a programming language up...  I flirt with it for a couple years, trying to convince myself that I really need it.

Well, I'm <i>really</i> liking Ruby now.  The reason is the whole "Ruby classes are never closed" thing.  Feel like going back and adding methods to a class?  Go for it.  Want to add methods to an individual object?  It'll create a virtual class for that object behind the scenes.  Mixins aren't so mysterious if you view them as a batch-adding of methods to an existing class.
