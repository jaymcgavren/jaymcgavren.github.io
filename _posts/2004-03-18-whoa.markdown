The Barenaked Ladies sure know how to give a concert.  They made lots of desert jokes, and they did a little song about the Phoenix zoo.  (Yeah, it was a stupid song, but it still makes you feel kinda special to have a one written just for your town.)  They did a cover of "Rio" for their second encore.  :)

Tempe Beach Park is a pretty cool place to hold a concert in, too.  We had a mountain on one side, two beautiful skyscrapers on another, a lit bridge on a third, the lake on the fourth, and planes coasting silently into PHX over our heads.  (BNL said the planes weren't real, just part of their high-budget special effects.)  Almost made me forget about the mosquitoes and the drunk woman who splashed beer on Diana.  :P

Anyway, a very good night overall, and a nice end to a stressful day.
