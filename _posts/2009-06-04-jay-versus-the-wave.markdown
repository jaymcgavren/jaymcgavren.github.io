Automatically translate text from one human language to another.  (Check.)
Publish journal entry to LiveJournal and e-mail.  (Check.)
Receive notification by e-mail of replies to message board topic.  (Check.)
Add item to to-do list.  (Check.)
Run/archive a mailing list.  (Check, only their implementation is better.)
Do not reveal existence of certain media to unauthorized users.  (Check.)

Some of the use cases I've been keeping for my "media server" project were knocked off like a checklist by the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ">Google Wave Developer Preview</a> presentation.

Infinite undo levels when editing.  (Well, this will be awkward with multiple collaborators.)
Mount a remote FTP site as a volume.  (Not even close.)
Transfer call to someone else's phone.  (Huh?)

Fortunately for me, some will <em>never</em> be, not by Wave.  Guess I still have work to do after all.
