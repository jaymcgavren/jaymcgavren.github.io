As I drove down the 202 this morning my phone buzzed, and as I answered I glimpsed Lenny's kindergarten teacher's name on the caller ID.  "Oh, no," I thought, "how can he be in trouble already?"

But no, she was calling for direction on releasing the Monarch butterfly, which was waiting on the remains of its chrysalis when she walked into the classroom this morning.  Evidently the kids were at that moment painting pictures of the butterfly, and voting on what to name it.

Whew.  That worked out well.  Many thanks, Aunt Laura!
