Well, I <em>was</em> liking Copernic Desktop Search 2.  But it just locked up my whole machine trying to preview an 8-meg plain-text log file (that I didn't even intend to view).

Google Desktop has been failing me lately (not finding documents, demaninding too much precision in search terms, etc.), which is why I switched.  But maybe the alternatives aren't that much better...
