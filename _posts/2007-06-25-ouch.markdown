$160 for the Chuck E Cheese party Saturday, plus $20 for a cake (which I didn't really get to see before it was cut to pieces).  Only 5 kids showed, but there were a ton of grown-ups.  It was loud and chaotic and I had no idea where Lenny was half the time.

Fortunately Holly, Amanda, Bryan and Katrina all helped with watching the baby (who slept through most of it), writing down givers of gifts, making sure people had pizza, keeping tabs on kids, etc. so that Diana and I didn't have to do much of anything.  So except for the amount of cash we spent, it was a pretty positive experience.

Heck, the pizza even tasted decent.
