Diana got tickets for us and Mom to the Chihuly blown glass exhibition at the botanical garden...  The artist is one of the few I know of that allows cameras into the exhibition, and shutterbugs came out of the woodwork for it.  All 3 of us were armed with our own point-and-shoots (one on loan from Diana's mom), and we fired off hundreds of shots between us until batteries started running out.

This one's off my camera phone; the proper pictures will be posted later.  Some will be going into a photo contest they're running, and judging from the unimaginative entries in the gallery, we might actually have a chance.
