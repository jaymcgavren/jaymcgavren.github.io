Went shopping for a birthday gift today, and realized a few things...

-I haven't been to a shopping mall in about a year.
-The main purpose of malls seems to be for teenagers to walk around trying to look pretty and/or tough.Â  (This is common knowledge, of course, but it only sank in today.)
-Malls contain things I don't want to buy at prices I'm not willing to pay.

This year, I'm gonna start my Christmas shopping early enough that I can just order everything from Amazon.
