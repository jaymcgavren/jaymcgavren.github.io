I kid you not...  The program I'm analyzing contains the following line of code:

<pre>set you_smell 'Y'</pre>

I *think* that's supposed to indicate that there's a problem with the system connection.  Of course, in other places they indicate that with the "hosed_ua" variable.

I want to go upstairs and inflict serious bodily harm on the person who wrote this unreadable crap...
