You've heard before that patterns at the micro scale are repeated in the macro.  Patterns in a fractal recur as you zoom in; the veins in a leaf look like the branches of a tree.

I suspect that procrastination at the individual level recurs at the societal level.  We're only moving on this global warming thing because now there are visible signs of climate change (and scientists telling us it's already too late).  We're only developing fuel-efficient cars because gas is over $4 a gallon.

I suppose we'll need a viral epidemic or food shortage (in a first-world country; we already have them elsewhere) to wake us up on the topic of overpopulation.
