Got our Chromecast a couple days ago, and it's an *awesome* way to view Netflix and YouTube on your TV.  Just pull out your phone, pick your program, and *then* it's sent to the television.  From there you can fast-forward, rewind, pause, and control the volume from your phone.  You can queue up your program while someone else finishes theirs.  If your TV has HDMI v1.4 (mine doesn't), the Chromecast will even turn it on and switch to the correct input for you.

One caveat - my phone sometimes loses its LAN connection to the Chromecast, and I have to flip through various menus to get it to resume control.  Time will tell how big a problem this is.  But since the device was $35, I won't be mad if it doesn't work out perfectly.
