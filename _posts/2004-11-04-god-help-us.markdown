So not only is Bush re-elected, the Republicans have expanded their majority in the Senate.  Conservative groups are telling the press they expect the administration will pursue a more conservative agenda this term, and more aggressively than before.  (Well, duh, but it's even scarier when you see it in print.)

I expect the draconian copyright laws, tax cuts for the rich, and public surveillance measures to start flowing any day now.  I'll do what I can to fight them (and I hope my like-minded friends will too), but I fear a few letters to Congress won't stop this administration from making life miserable for America's middle class for decades to come.
