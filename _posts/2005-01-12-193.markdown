Diana went shopping for a cocktail dress last night for the upcoming employee party, and she's considering some <i>really</i> fancy ones.  She's had me thinking about renting a tux, but a co-worker advised against it.  Evidently the women always dress up for these things, and the men always wear whatever's in the closet (a sport coat, in my case).  We're going to look pretty mismatched, though...

Anyway, she seems really excited about the whole thing.  She's lost a lot of weight, so this is her chance to go show off, and I'm not about to hold her back.
