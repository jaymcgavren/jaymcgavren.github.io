Not because it's bad, but because of the addictive properties of the lead singer's voice.

I haven't decided whether I like it, but she's got some weird vibrato that makes it impossible to get out of your head after hearing it.  I'm sure that's why Apple chose them for the iPod ads (and why Diana had me fetch all their music I could find).
