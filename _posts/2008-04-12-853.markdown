Got a phone call <em>from my Mom</em> this morning to let me know the photo of my niece wasn't visible - to everyone <em>besides</em> me.  Guess I had a little too much faith in Flock; I thought it would save the image and then upload it to Wordpress, but it just linked it from my GMail account (to which I have access but no one else does).  It's also crapping Technorati tags all over my entries instead of using Wordpress categories.  I may be reverting to Firefox soon.
