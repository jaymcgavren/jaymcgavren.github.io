Was over at the used bookstore getting Putt-Putt PC games for Lenny (his current obsession).  Some random lady, seeing the stack of boxes on my arm, stops me and hands me a 15% off coupon.

I've been spurned, ignored, or looked at funny enough times that I don't stop and try to help people anymore, and I'm sure most others living in big cities are the same.  It's really too bad, because the desire to aid others is surely part of how we survived this long as a species.

Among today's purchases: <a href="http://www.innovatelikeedison.com/">Innovate Like Edison: The Success System of America's Greatest Inventor</a>.  I had intended to do this homework myself, but it looks like I get to mooch off someone else's crib sheet.
