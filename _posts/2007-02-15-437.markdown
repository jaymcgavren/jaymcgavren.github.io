It's 11 PM and I'm in the middle of work, with a one-week-old baby sleeping on my lap.  I'm working now because I was unable to rouse myself before 1 in the afternoon, and I spent most of the day running around trying to take care of Diana (who has to spend all her time taking care of the baby).

Has this kid fucked with my schedule?  Naaah...
