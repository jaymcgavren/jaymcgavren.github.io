Diana left the garage door cracked last night, and both she and her mom were pretty sure no one could have squeezed under it.  But this morning I found it standing wide open, and her car door ajar.

Looks like all they took were her music CDs; her stereo was still in place, as were all the other contents of the garage.  Musta been some kid, because a junkie would've then gone into the house (through the unlocked inner door) and taken purses/electronics/lives/etc.

I told Diana not to bother with a police report.  But hopefully she'll start locking her car even when it's in the garage, as I've been doing.
